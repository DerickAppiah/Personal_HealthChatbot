However, sometimes HPV stays \\nwithin the body and can lead to genital/anal\\nwarts and a variety of cancers, including\\ncervical, penile, head, and neck cancers.\\nSome types of HPV are classified as high \\nrisk, as they can lead to cancers of the anus \\nand genital area, cervical cancer, and certain \\ncancers of the head and neck. Some of these \\nhigh-risk HPV types include types 16 , 18, 31, \\n33, 45, 52, and 58. These types of HPV do \\nnot lead to warts.\\nOther types are classified as low risk, as they do not lead to cancer – but they can lead to lesions \\nsuch as genital and anal warts. Some of these low-risk HPV types include types 6 and 11 . Warts can \\nrange in appearance and size. For example, some warts may appear as small bumps, while others \\nmay have a large “cauliflower”-like appearance. The warts caused by HPV do not normally cause \\ndiscomfort, but they can sometimes become itchy, burn, or bleed.\\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infections are the most common \\nsexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the world. There are over \\n100 types of human papillomaviruses, and 40 types are known \\nto affect the anus and genital area of humans. It is estimated that \\naround 75% of sexually active Canadians who have not been\\nimmunized against HPV will have an HPV infection at some point \\nin their life. While most HPV infections will go away on their own \\nand not cause any symptoms, infection can sometimes lead to\\ngenital warts and cancers.\\nYou should \\nknow\\nYou can be infected \\nwith more than one \\ntype of HPV at a time. \\nThere are two HPV vaccines approved for use in Canada: the HPV2 vaccine (Cervarix®) and \\nthe HPV9 vaccine (Gardasil®9). Both vaccines protect against high-risk HPV types 16 and 18 — \\nthe two types that cause the majority of HPV-related cancers. The HPV9 vaccine additionally \\nprotects against high-risk types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, as well as low-risk types 6 and 11.\\nVaccine availability differs by province and territory.'),\n",

HPV can spread from one \\npartner to another, even if the person with HPV has no visible symptoms such as warts. HPV is also \\nspread when someone comes into contact with warts caused by HPV. \\nAlthough rare, HPV can also be passed from birthing parent to baby during childbirth, if the birthing \\nparent has genital HPV infection.\\nWho is affected by HPV?\\nAnyone of any age, gender, or sexual\\norientation can get HPV. However, there are \\nsome groups that get it more than others. \\nFor people who have previously had another \\nsexually transmitted infection (STI) or those \\nwho have a weakened immune system (for \\nexample, if they have HIV), the chances of \\ngetting HPV can be higher.\\nGay, bisexual, and other men who have sex \\nwith men (gbMSM) get HPV at high rates, \\nincluding with types 16 and 18, which lead to \\nmost HPV-related cancers. There is research \\nthat shows that gbMSM are 20 times more \\nlikely to develop anal cancer than other men \\nwho do not have sex with men. As the HPV \\nvaccine was initially offered only to girls and \\nwomen in Canada, men may not have received\\nthe same messaging around how to protect \\nthemselves from HPV. Knowing more about \\nHPV, how it can affect one’s health, and how \\nto prevent it can help gbMSM make informed \\ndecisions about their sexual health.\\nAs well, gbMSM face other barriers to cancer \\ncare and HPV immunization uptake. These \\nbarriers include fear — or the experience of \\ndiscrimination by healthcare professionals \\nand having a previous negative experience \\nwith the medical system due to their sexual \\norientation, among others.\\nEvidence is also emerging that trans and gender-\\ndiverse (TGD) people are more affected by HPV \\ntypes that can cause cancer at high rates. TGD \\npeople face similar barriers to cancer care as \\nthose faced by gbMSM, including fear of\\ndiscrimination and having previous negative\\nexperiences with the healthcare system. As \\nwell, healthcare professionals generally have a \\nlack of knowledge about TGD-specific cancer \\ncare. Knowing about HPV, how it can affect \\ntheir health, and how to prevent it can help TGD \\npeople make informed decisions about their \\nsexual health.\\nIn general, the more sexual partners you have\\nhad, the more likely it becomes that you will be\\nexposed to, or will have previously been exposed\\nto, HPV. Remember, this is a generalized statement,\\nas you can still be exposed to HPV the first\\ntime you partake in sexual activities if your\\npartner(s) has/have HPV.'),\n",

The most \\nreliable ways to avoid transmission of STDs are to abstain from sexual activity, or to be in \\na long-term mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner.  However, \\nmany infected persons may be unaware of their infection because STDs often are asymp-\\ntomatic and unrecognized. \\nCondom effectiveness for STD and HIV prevention has been demonstrated by both laboratory \\nand epidemiologic studies. Evidence of condom effectiveness is also based on theoretical and \\nempirical data regarding the transmission of different STDs, the physical properties of condoms, \\nand the anatomic coverage or protection provided by condoms.\\nLaboratory studies have shown that latex condoms provide an effective barrier against \\neven the smallest STD pathogens.\\nEpidemiologic studies that compare rates of HIV infection between condom users \\nand nonusers who have HIV-infected sex partners demonstrate that consistent condom \\nuse is highly effective in preventing transmission of HIV . Similarly, epidemiologic \\nstudies have shown that condom use reduces the risk of many other STDs. However, \\nthe exact magnitude of protection has been difficult to quantify because of numerous \\nmethodological challenges inherent in studying private behaviors that cannot be directly \\nobserved or measured.\\nTheoretical and empirical basis for protection: Condoms can be expected to provide \\ndifferent levels of protection for various STDs, depending on differences in how the \\ndiseases or infections are transmitted. Male condoms may not cover all infected areas \\nor areas that could become infected.  Th us, they are likely to provide greater protection \\nagainst STDs that are transmitted only by genital fluids (STDs such as gonorrhea, \\nchlamydia, trichomoniasis, and HIV infection) than against infections that are \\ntransmitted primarily by skin-to-skin contact, which may or may not infect areas covered \\nby a condom (STDs such as genital herpes, human papillomavirus [HPV] infection, \\nsyphilis, and chancroid).\\nHIV Infection\\nConsistent and correct use of latex condoms is highly  effective in preventing \\nsexual transmission of HIV , the virus that causes AIDS.\\nOther STDs and \\nAssociated Conditions \\nConsistent and correct use of latex condoms reduces the risk for many STDs \\nthat are transmitted by genital fluids (STDs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and \\ntrichomoniasis). \\nConsistent and correct use of latex condoms reduces the risk for genital ulcer \\ndiseases, such as genital herpes, syphilis, and chancroid, only when the infected \\narea or site of potential exposure is   \\n protected. \\nConsistent and correct use of latex condoms may reduce the risk for genital \\nhuman papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV-associated diseases (e.g., genital \\nwarts and cervical cancer).'),\n",

STIs are among the most common communicable infections \\naffecting the health and lives of people worldwide. Sexually transmitted pathogens have the \\nability to compromise the quality of life, as well as sexual and reproductive health, and newborn \\nhealth1. STIs can also indirectly expedite the sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency \\nvirus (HIV) and can cause cellular changes that may precede some cancers1,2. Rates of \\nnotifiable STIs have increased despite numerous public health interventions designed to \\nstrengthen awareness and to prevent, diagnose and treat infection. There are various potential \\nfactors that may explain these observations such as true rise in incidence, the use of improved \\ndiagnostic methods, and more effective contact tracing and case finding2. \\n \\nTo address the STI epidemic, the World Health Organization, in 2016, published the Global \\nHealth Sector Strategy on Sexually Transmitted Infections, 2016-2021:  Towards Ending STIs1. \\nSupporting the goals and targets of this global strategy, the Government of Canada, in June \\n2018, released the Pan-Canadian Sexually Transmitted and Blood-Borne Infection Framework \\nfor Action3. \\n \\nIn July 2019, in response to the Framework, the Government of Canada launched its action plan \\n– Accelerating our Response:  Government of Canada Five-Year Action Plan on Sexually \\nTransmitted and Blood-Borne Infections4, which emphasizes the tangible actions to be \\nundertaken over the next five years to move Canada closer to achieving the strategic goals \\noutlined in the Framework. Included is the development of Canadian-made targets and \\nindicators, which will drive our domestic actions and unify us in our commitment to specific \\nresults4. Given the importance that monitoring and surveillance data reporting has on measuring \\nthe success of our actions, one of the key commitments outlined is the strengthening of \\nCanada’s national surveillance systems4. \\n \\nThis report provides an update on the epidemiology of three nationally notifiable STIs in \\nCanada:  chlamydia, gonorrhea and infectious syphilis (including congenital syphilis) using data \\nup to 2018, by province/territory, age group and sex. In addition, updated information related to \\nsyphilis collected through the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) Syphilis Outbreak \\nInvestigation Coordination Committee (SOICC) have been included.'),\n",

Provincial and territorial health authorities provide non-nominal \\ndata on laboratory-confirmed cases. Variables submitted by all reporting jurisdictions are:  age \\nat diagnosis, year of diagnosis, province/territory of diagnosis, and sex. As such, national \\nreporting is limited to analyses of these variables. CNDSS staff validate the reported data with \\nthe submitting province or territory during data processing to resolve data errors or \\ninconsistencies and maximize accuracy. Chlamydia has been nationally notifiable since 1991 \\nwhile gonorrhea and syphilis have been notifiable since 19246. Extracts from the CNDSS are \\nused as the basis for national surveillance reports; this report is based on data extracted in April \\n2020. Historical data for all three nationally notifiable STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhea and infectious \\nsyphilis) were available from all provinces and territories from 2009 to 2017. For 2018, data from \\nBritish Columbia was not available, and as such, not included in the analyses for 2018. \\n \\nIn July 2019, PHAC established a SOICC to support the coordination of the Canadian response \\nin dealing with the rise in the number of syphilis cases and jurisdictionally declared outbreaks. \\nAll of the provinces and territories have collected and shared with PHAC preliminary 2018 \\nenhanced syphilis surveillance data. \\n \\n3.2 Case Definitions \\nCase definitions for all three nationally notifiable STIs are available online. \\n \\n3.3 Data Analysis \\nA descriptive analysis of reported chlamydia, gonorrhea and infectious syphilis cases by year, \\nage groupand sex was conducted using data reported to the CNDSS using SAS, SPSS and \\nMicrosoft Excel. All reported cases of chlamydia and gonorrhea are included in national-level \\nanalysis. Only data on infectious syphilis cases (including primary, secondary, early latent and \\ninfectious neurosyphilis stages) are presented in this report. \\n \\nNational annual rates of reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and infectious syphilis were \\ncomputed using the number of cases from the CNDSS as numerators and Statistics Canada \\n2018 yearly population estimates as denominators. Rates, percentages and change in rates \\nwere calculated using unrounded numbers; no statistical procedures were used for comparative \\nanalyses. Observed trends over time must be interpreted with caution, as rates based on small \\nnumbers are prone to fluctuation over time. Previous reports may present different rates for \\nsome years due to improved diagnostic capabilities, improved duplicate removal, shortened \\nreporting delay and changes in reporting practices at the jurisdictional level.  \\n \\nSupplementary tables are listed in Appendix A and are available upon request.'),\n",

Rates have been increasing steadily since 19972. \\nSince asymptomatic infections are common in men and women, affected individuals unaware of \\ntheir status9, in the absence of screening, can contribute to the spread of infection. \\n \\nThe number of rates of reported chlamydia cases continue to increase. In Canada, between \\n2009 and 2018, the number of reported chlamydia cases increased steadily, from 87,283 to \\n117,008.

Only early congenital syphilis \\ncases (diagnosed in those under two years of age) are reported nationally6. \\n \\nThe number of confirmed congenital syphilis cases reported in Canada varied from one to 20 \\ncases per year from 2009 to 2018 (Figure 19). Between 2009 and 2014, a downward trend was \\nobserved in reported cases (high of 10 cases in 2009 and a low of one case reported in 2014) \\nfollowed by increase of up to twenty reported cases in 2018. From 2017 to 2018, there was a \\n188.8% increase in rate of congenital syphilis cases (from 1.9 to 5.4 cases per 100,000 live \\nbirths). Among females aged 15 to 39 years, a 211.5% increase in rate of infectious syphilis was \\nobserved between 2017 and 2018 (from 6.1 to 19.0 cases per 100,000 females). Changes in \\nrate should be interpreted with caution due to low case numbers (Figure 19). \\n \\nFigure 19.

Over the past decade, rates for all STIs have \\nincreased dramatically. In addition, it is possible that many cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and \\ninfectious syphilis continue to go undiagnosed and unreported. Strong public health \\ninfrastructure is critical to prevent and control STIs, especially among the most vulnerable \\ngroups.  \\n \\nChlamydia continues to be the most commonly reported STI in Canada with 117,008 cases \\nreported across Canada in 2018 (Note: 2018 numbers for chlamydia and gonorrhea do not \\ninclude British Columbia). \\n \\nOver the past decade, increases in the rates of reported cases of chlamydia have been \\nobserved in Canada despite numerous public health interventions designed to prevent, \\ndiagnose and treat infection. The observed increases in rates may be explained by a variety of \\nfactors including a true rise in incidence and the implementation of improved detection methods \\nsuch as more sensitive nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) introduced in the mid-1990s. In \\nfact, the introduction of NAAT coincided with the beginning of the historical rise in rates of \\nreported cases of chlamydia. NAAT allows for the use of either urine specimens or swabs, and \\nurine collection is easier and more acceptable to patients. As a result, the number of people, \\nparticularly males, being tested has likely increased as well. More screening and more effective \\ncontact tracing practices may also have contributed to the observed rise in the rate of reported \\ncases. \\n \\nAlthough the rates of reported cases of gonorrhea in Canada are considerably lower than those \\nfor chlamydia, rates for both infections appear to be increasing over time. The increase in \\ngonorrhea rates since the late 1990s may be at least partially explained by the factors thought \\nto also affect chlamydia rates, such as the move to more sensitive testing methods and \\nimproved case finding2. Additionally, both Canadian and other national treatment guidelines \\nemphasize the importance of screening at other anatomical sites in some populations, which \\nmay have impacted the increase in the number of cases detected and reported10,13,14. \\n \\nIn contrast to chlamydia, observed overall rates of gonorrhea were higher in males. Higher \\ngonorrhea rates among males may be partially explained by the fact that they are more likely \\nthan females to have symptomatic infections15; the presence of symptoms likely influences care-\\nseeking behaviors and could contribute to the greater number of cases detected among males. \\nIn addition, increases in certain sex practices among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex \\nwith men (gbMSM) have been associated with increases in gonorrhea in this population10. Other \\nhigh-income countries, including the United States of America, Australia and England have \\nreported similar trends13,16,17. \\n \\nTogether with improved testing and screening methods, antimicrobial resistance to the first-line \\nantibiotics also play a role in the rising rates of gonorrhea. Over time, an increasing proportion \\nof Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates has shown resistance to many antibiotics used to treat \\ninfection18,19,20. In 2018, seven extensively drug resistant gonorrhea isolates were identified in \\nCanada, posing a potential threat to successful treatment21. Enhancing surveillance to include \\nlinked epidemiological and laboratory data would address the limitation regarding trend \\ninterpretation in the current passive surveillance system.

Similar to gonorrhea, and in contrast with chlamydia, observed overall rates \\nof infectious syphilis continue to be higher in males. Although rates of infectious syphilis among \\nfemales are lower than the male rate, rates are increasing faster among females in recent \\nyears; infection in women of childbearing age is of concern because of the potential for \\ncongenital syphilis in infants exposed to Treponema pallidum prenatally or during childbirth. \\nScreening for syphilis as part of comprehensive prenatal care for all pregnant women, as well as \\nfostering an enabling environment for pregnant individuals to access STBBI care3, are both key \\nto preventing congenital syphilis. \\n \\nOver the past decade, when compared to counties such as the United States13, England16, and \\nAustralia17, Canada continues to have the lowest rates of chlamydia, gonorrhea and infectious \\nsyphilis. The pattern of higher rates of chlamydia amongst females seen in Canada is similarly \\nseen across these countries. Canada’s gonorrhea rates among males are consistently lower \\nthan those in these countries, and among females, Canada has the second-lowest rates. Rates \\nof infectious syphilis are increasing in Canada, in the United States13, England16, and \\nAustralia17. From 2009 to 2018, Canada reported the lowest rates of infectious syphilis \\ncompared to these other countries, although there is some variability in reporting. All of these \\ncountries show infectious syphilis rates being significantly higher among males compared to \\nfemales. The observed difference in rates observed among these countries can likely be \\nattributed, in part, to differences in reporting requirements, screening practices, educational \\nprograms, and public health interventions.  \\n \\nLastly, the surveillance data described in this report have data limitations. Low case counts are \\nsometimes reported for particular infections and certain age groups, such as for congenital \\nsyphilis. Therefore, variations in rates over time should be interpreted with caution. Also, data \\npresented in this report likely underestimate the incidence rate of STIs from 2009 to 2018 in \\nCanada, as some infections may be asymptomatic, unscreened, undiagnosed or unreported. \\nScreening, laboratory testing and reporting practices varied across provinces and territories. \\nThis means that direct comparison between jurisdictions should be made with caution. Finally, \\ninformation on risk factors in unavailable in the CNDSS, limiting our ability to identify factors \\nassociated with higher STI rates. \\n \\nSTIs continue to remain a serious public health concern in Canada. Over the past decade, \\nreported rates for chlamydia, gonorrhea and infectious syphilis continued to increase \\nsubstantially.'),\n",

It is important to \\nknow that even without signs of \\nthe disease, it can still spread to \\nsexual partners.    \\nWhat is genital herpes?\\nGenital herpes is an STD caused by two types of viruses. The viruses are \\ncalled herpes simplex type 1 and herpes simplex type 2.\\nHow common is genital herpes?\\nGenital herpes is common in the United States. In the United States, about \\none out of every six people aged 14 to 49 years have genital herpes.\\nHow is genital herpes spread?\\nYou can get herpes by having oral, vaginal, or anal sex with someone who \\nhas the disease. \\nFluids found in a herpes sore carry the virus, and contact with those \\nfluids can cause infection. You can also get herpes from an infected sex \\npartner who does not have a visible sore or who may not know he or she \\nis infected because the virus can be released through your skin and spread \\nthe infection to your sex partner(s). \\nHow can I reduce my risk of getting herpes?\\nThe only way to avoid STDs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.\\nIf you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your \\nchances of getting herpes:  \\n• Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a \\npartner who has been tested and has negative STD test results; \\n• Using latex condoms the right way every time you have sex. \\nHerpes symptoms can occur in both male and female genital ar\\neas that \\nare covered by a latex condom. However, outbreaks can also occur in areas \\nthat are not covered by a condom so condoms may not fully protect you \\nfrom getting herpes.\\nI’m pregnant. How could genital herpes affect my baby?\\nIf you are pregnant and have genital herpes, it is even more important for \\nyou to go to prenatal care visits. You need to tell your doctor if you have \\never had symptoms of, been exposed to, or been diagnosed with genital \\nherpes. Sometimes genital herpes infection can lead to miscarriage. It \\ncan also make it more likely for you to deliver your baby too early. Herpes \\ninfection can be passed from you to your unborn child and cause a \\npotentially deadly infection (neonatal herpes). It is important that you \\navoid getting herpes during pregnancy.\\nIf you are pregnant and have genital herpes, you may be offered herpes \\nmedicine towards the end of your pregnancy to reduce the risk of having \\nany symptoms and passing the disease to your baby. At the time of \\ndelivery your doctor should carefully examine you for symptoms. If you \\nhave herpes symptoms at delivery, a ‘C-section’ is usually performed.\\nHow do I know if I have genital herpes?\\nMost people who have herpes have no, or very mild symptoms.

Because of this, most people who \\nhave herpes do not know it. \\nGenital herpes sores usually appear as one or more blisters on or around the \\ngenitals, rectum or mouth.

Providers can also take a sample from the sore(s) \\nand test it. Have an honest and open talk with your health care provider and ask \\nwhether you should be tested for herpes or other STDs. \\nCan herpes be cured?\\nThere is no cure for herpes. However, there are medicines that can prevent or \\nshorten outbreaks. One of these herpes medicines can be taken daily, and makes \\nit less likely that you will pass the infection on to your sex partner(s).\\nWhat happens if I don’t get treated?\\nGenital herpes can cause painful genital sores and can be severe in people with \\nsuppressed immune systems. If you touch your sores or the fluids from the sores, \\nyou may transfer herpes to another part of your body, such as your eyes. Do not \\ntouch the sores or fluids to avoid spreading herpes to another part of your body. \\nIf you touch the sores or fluids, immediately wash your hands thoroughly to help \\navoid spreading your infection.\\nSome people who get genital herpes have concerns about how it will impact their \\noverall health, sex life, and relationships. It is best for you to talk to a health care \\nprovider about those concerns, but it also is important to recognize that while \\nherpes is not curable, it can be managed. Since a genital herpes diagnosis may \\naffect how you will feel about current or future sexual relationships, it is important \\nto understand how to talk to sexual partners about STDs.

Although \\nsymptoms of the disease vary, most women and men who have the parasite cannot tell \\nthey are infected.\\nHow common is trichomoniasis?\\nTrichomoniasis is considered the most common curable STD. In the United States, \\nan estimated 3.7 million people have the infection, but only about 30% develop any \\nsymptoms of trichomoniasis. Infection is more common in women than in men, and  \\nolder women are more likely than younger women to have been infected.\\nHow do people get trichomoniasis?\\nThe parasite is passed from an infected person to an uninfected person during sex.  In women, the most commonly infected \\npart of the body is the lower genital tract (vulva, vagina, or urethra), and in men, the most commonly infected body part is \\nthe inside of the penis (urethra). During sex, the parasite is usually transmitted from a penis to \\na vagina, or from a vagina to a penis, but it can also be passed from a vagina to another vagina.  \\nIt is not common for the parasite to infect other body parts, like the hands, mouth, or anus.  It is \\nunclear why some people with the infection get symptoms while others do not, but it probably \\ndepends on factors like the person’s age and overall health.  Infected people without symptoms \\ncan still pass the infection on to others. \\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of trichomoniasis?\\nAbout 70% of infected people do not have any signs or symptoms.  When trichomoniasis does \\ncause symptoms, they can range from mild irritation to severe inflammation. Some people with \\nsymptoms get them within 5 to 28 days after being infected, but others do not develop  \\nsymptoms until much later. Symptoms can come and go.\\nMen with trichomoniasis may feel itching or irritation inside the penis, burning after urination or ejaculation, or some \\ndischarge from the penis.  \\nWomen with trichomoniasis may notice itching, burning, redness or soreness of the genitals, discomfort with urination, or  \\na thin discharge with an unusual smell that can be clear, white, yellowish, or greenish.  \\nHaving trichomoniasis can make it feel unpleasant to have sex. Without treatment, the infection can last for months or  \\neven years.\\nWhat are the complications of trichomoniasis?\\nTrichomoniasis can increase the risk of getting or spreading other sexually transmitted infections. For example, \\ntrichomoniasis can cause genital inflammation that makes it easier to get infected with the HIV virus, or to pass the HIV virus \\non to a sex partner. \\nHow does trichomoniasis affect a pregnant woman and her baby? \\n \\nPregnant women with trichomoniasis are more likely to have their babies too early (preterm delivery). Also, babies born to \\ninfected mothers are more likely to have an officially low birth weight (less than 5.5 pounds).\\nTrichomoniasis - CDC Fact Sheet\\nTwo Trichomonas vaginalis parasites,  \\nmagnified (seen under a microscope)'),\n",

For both \\nmen and women, your primary care doctor or another trusted health care provider \\nmust do a check and a laboratory test to diagnose trichomoniasis.\\nWhat is the treatment for trichomoniasis?\\nTrichomoniasis can be cured with a single dose of prescription antibiotic \\nmedication (either metronidazole or tinidazole), pills which can be taken by mouth. \\nIt is okay for pregnant women to take this medication. Some people who drink \\nalcohol within 24 hours after taking this kind of antibiotic can have uncomfortable \\nside effects.  \\nPeople who have been treated for trichomoniasis can get it again.  About 1 in \\n5 people get infected again within 3 months after treatment.  To avoid getting \\nreinfected, make sure that all of your sex partners get treated too, and wait to have \\nsex again until all of your symptoms go away (about a week).  Get checked again if \\nyour symptoms come back. \\nHow can trichomoniasis be prevented?\\nUsing latex condoms correctly every time you have sex will help reduce the risk of \\ngetting or spreading trichomoniasis. However, condoms don’t cover everything, \\nand it is possible to get or spread this infection even when using a condom.  \\nThe only sure way to prevent sexually transmitted infections is to avoid having sex \\nentirely.  Another approach is to talk about these kinds of infections before you \\nhave sex with a new partner, so that you can make informed choices about the \\nlevel of risk you are comfortable taking with your sex life.  \\nIf you or someone you know has questions about trichomoniasis or any other STD, \\nespecially with symptoms like unusual discharge, burning during urination, or a \\nsore in the genital area, check in with a health care provider and get some answers.\\nCDC National Prevention Information \\n(NPIN) \\nP .O.

Research ﬁndings available since the NIH review add considerably to the evidence of the \\neffectiveness of condoms against STIs.

Holmes et al.   Effectiveness of condoms in preventing STIs \\nBased on the results of the remaining prospective studies, \\nthe panel reached three key conclusions. First, consistent condom \\nuse (i.e., using condoms during every act of vaginal intercourse) \\namong heterosexual couples in which one partner was infected \\nwith HIV reduced the risk of HIV transmission from men to \\nwomen and vice versa. This ﬁnding was based on a meta-analysis \\nof condom effectiveness studies by Davis & Weller (2). They \\nestimated that compared with no condom use, consistent con-\\ndom use resulted in an overall 87% reduction in risk of HIV \\ntransmission, with the best-case and worst-case scenarios ranging \\nfrom 60% to 96%. In an update of this analysis, Weller & \\nDavis reported a revised estimate of an 80% reduction in risk \\nwith a range of 35–94% (3).\\nSecond, the NIH report concluded that consistent con-\\ndom use may reduce the risk of gonorrhoea in men. This ﬁnding \\nwas based on a 1978 report by Hooper et al. (4), which was a \\nprospective study of the risk of transmission of gonorrhoea to \\nmen in the United States Navy from a pool of women with a \\nknown prevalence of gonorrhoea. A subsequent reanalysis of \\nthose data showed that condoms provided a statistically sig-\\nniﬁcant level of protection against the combined outcome of \\ngonorrhoea or nongonococcal urethritis in exposed men (5).\\nThird, due to insufﬁcient evidence from prospective \\nstudies, the reviewers were unable to determine the effectiveness \\nof condoms in preventing gonorrhoea and chlamydial infection \\nin women, or in preventing syphilis, chancroid, trichomoniasis, \\ngenital herpes or genital HPV inf ection in men or women. The \\npanel strongly cautioned the public against misinterpreting the \\nscanty evidence. The small number of well designed prospec-\\ntive studies precluded the panel from making judgments about \\nthe effectiveness of condoms in preventing other STIs; the \\nreviews stated that the lack of data were not to be construed \\nas evidence either supporting or denying the effectiveness of \\ncondoms.\\nAs the NIH prepared to release its report in July 2001, \\nother health agencies responded to the pending report (6, 7). \\nFor example, the CDC reviewed its treatment guidelines for \\nSTIs that were issued in 2000, and in the same month that the \\nNIH released its report, reasserted the protective value of con-\\ndoms against STIs (7). WHO included condom programmes \\namong the essential components of public health packages for \\npreventing and controlling STIs in the most recent edition \\nof the Guidelines for the management of sexually transmitted \\ninfections (8).\\nSince the NIH review, reports of several additional pro-\\nspective studies have further addressed the effectiveness of \\ncondoms. A literature review by Hearst & Chen (9) considered \\nseveral lines of evidence for the efﬁcacy of condom use and \\nother behavioural changes in preventing the sexual transmission \\nof HIV; it also discussed related issues about HIV prevention \\nprogrammes.\\nWe examine ﬁndings that have become available since \\nJune 2000 from prospective studies of the effectiveness of male \\ncondoms in preventing STIs and brieﬂy discuss the limitations \\nof these studies and the effectiveness of programmes to promote \\ncondom use.\\nMethods\\nWe searched Medline for articles published in English after \\nJune 2000 with the keyword “effectiveness” and the MeSH \\nheading “condom” and with the following three MeSH terms: \\n“condoms”, “evaluation studies”, and “sexually transmitted \\ndiseases”. We reviewed the abstracts of the selected studies to \\nidentify prospective cohort studies. We also conducted a lim-\\nited search for randomized controlled trials using the MeSH \\nheading “condom” and the MeSH term “sexually transmitted \\ndiseases”. In addition, we identiﬁed and reviewed other articles, \\nreports and abstracts that we were aware of having been pub-\\nlished, presented, or reported after June 2000.\\nFindings\\nPoint estimates and conﬁdence intervals of prospective studies  \\non the effectiveness of condom use in preventing STIs are \\npresented in Fig. 1. A summary of the design and participants \\nin those studies can be found in Table 1 (web version only, \\navailable at: http://www.who.int/bulletin).\\nHerpes simplex virus type 2\\nGenital herpes, usually caused by infection with herpes simplex \\nvirus type 2 (HSV-2), is a chronic disease found throughout \\nthe world; in sub-Saharan Africa, the seroprevalence of HSV-2 \\nis 70% or higher. Genital HSV infection is transmissible even \\nwhen partners have no active genital symptoms or lesions.\\nProspective studies conducted in the United States have \\nshown that condoms partially protect men and women against \\nnew infections with HSV-2 (12, A. Wald et al., unpublished \\ndata presented at the 2002 National STD Prevention Confer-\\nence in San Diego, CA). In one study (12), Wald et al. analysed \\ndata from an HSV-2 candidate vaccine trial conducted in \\nthe mid-1990s that followed 528 monogamous, HSV-2-dis-\\ncordant couples (one partner was infected with HSV-2, the \\nother was not) for 18 months. The median reported use of \\ncondoms was 25% ; it was relatively low because the couples \\nwere monogamous. Using condoms during more than 25% \\nof sex acts was associated with a 92% reduction in the risk of \\nwomen acquiring HSV-2 but was not associated with a protec-\\ntive effect among men.\\nHowever, in a separate trial of this candidate vaccine \\namong people with more than three sexual partners or at least \\none STI in the past year, Wald et al. found that the median \\nreported use of condoms was 65%, and that using condoms \\nduring more than 65% of acts of vaginal or rectal penetration \\nprovided partial protection for men (A. Wald et al., unpub-\\nlished data, presented at the 2002 National STD Prevention \\nConference in San Diego, CA). Nonetheless, HSV-2 infection \\nwas acquired, although rarely, even by people who reported \\nusing condoms during 100% of sexual activity.\\nGonorrhoea, chlamydial infection, trichomoniasis \\nand syphilis\\nFor the ﬁrst time, Sanchez et al. (13) demonstrated the statis-\\ntically signiﬁcant effectiveness of condoms in preventing not \\nonly gonorrhoea, but also chlamydial infection and trichomo-\\nniasis in women. A cohort of 917 female sex workers in Lima, \\nPeru, were re-examined monthly for STIs; they were also given \\ncondoms. During the observation period of 7908 person-\\nmonths, the reported rate of consistent condom use rose by \\n20%. Compared with all others, those women who reported \\nusing condoms consistently since the previous examination \\nhad a 62% reduction in the risk of acquiring gonorrhoea and \\na 26% reduction in the risk of acquiring chlamydial infection. \\nThere was also evidence of a signiﬁcant reduction in the risk \\nof acquiring trichomoniasis.'),\n",

Neither of the two prospective \\nstudies reviewed found that consistent condom use was effective \\nin preventing genital HPV infection or HPV-related condi-\\ntions. Subsequently, Winer et al. (19) followed 444 female \\nstudents at university as part of a longitudinal study of the \\ncumulative incidence of genital HPV infection. They found \\nthat consistently using condoms with a new partner was not \\nassociated with significant protection against HPV (hazard \\nratio (HR) = 0.8; 95% CI = 0.5–1.2). Data on condom \\nbreakage or vaginal penetration before condoms were put \\non were not collected, nor was the analysis adjusted for \\nfrequency of intercourse.\\nDunne et al. reviewed the methods of 44 studies con -\\nducted between 1996 and 2001 that examined condom use, \\nHPV infection, and HPV-related conditions (EF Dunne et al., \\nunpublished data presented at the HPV Clinical Workshop and \\n20th International Papillomavirus Conference, Paris, 2002). \\nThey found that methodological limitations made it difﬁcult \\nto accurately assess condom effectiveness, and they called for \\nstudies to consider the consistency and correctness of condom \\nuse, incident infections, and the infection status of the partner \\nin the design of studies.\\nIn a unique clinical trial in the Netherlands, Hogewoning \\net al. (20) randomly allocated 135 women not regularly using \\ncondoms who had untreated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia \\n(CIN) and their male partners either to use condoms or not use \\ncondoms for all instances of vaginal intercourse. Those couples \\nrandomized to use condoms had a signiﬁcantly higher cumu-\\nlative two-year rate of disease regression (53% versus 35%; \\nHR = 3.1; 95% CI = 1.4–7.1) as well as a higher cumulative \\ntwo-year rate of HPV clearance (23% versus 4%; HR = 12.1; \\n95% CI = 1.5–97.2).\\nBleeker et al. ( 21) examined the male partners of the \\nwomen in this study for the presence of penile lesions and for \\nHPV using polymerase chain reaction testing of penile swabs. \\nConsistent condom use over a minimum period of three months \\nwas associated with a reduction in the median time until clinical \\nregression of all penile lesions (HR for regression = 1.8; 95% \\nCI = 1.0–3.3; P = 0.05 by Cox regression analysis). Interpreting \\nthe ﬁndings of these two studies is not simple ( 20, 21). The \\nauthors suggest that transmission of HPV back and forth be-\\ntween partners during unprotected sex may prolong the duration \\nof HPV infection, CIN, and penile lesions.\\nDiscussion\\nThis review of prospective studies published since June 2000 \\nhas identiﬁed evidence that consistent condom use is associated \\nnot only with reduced transmission of HIV and with reduced \\nacquisition of urethral infection among men, but also with:\\n• reduced acquisition of genital HSV-2 infection by men and  \\n women;\\n• reduced acquisition of syphilis by men and women;\\n• reduced acquisition of chlamydial infection by men and   \\n women;\\n• reduced acquisition of gonorrhoea by women \\n• possibly reduced acquisition of trichomoniasis infection by  \\n women;\\n• accelerated regression of cervical and penile HPV-associated  \\n lesions and accelerated clearance of genital HPV infection  \\n by women.\\nLimitations of studies\\nOnly in prospective studies can the temporal relationship \\nbetween STIs and condom use be explored. Because many \\nprospective studies have now shown that condom use reduces \\nthe transmission of HIV and several other STIs, randomized \\ntrials with a high-risk control group that doesn’t use condoms \\nhave been viewed as unwarranted. Although many studies have \\nrandomly allocated people or samples to various prevention in-\\nterventions that included the enhanced promotion of condom \\nuse, we believe the two studies of couples with HPV-related \\nconditions (20, 21) are the only trials in which participants \\nwere randomly allocated to condom use or no condom use. The \\nstudy was strengthened by randomization of couples rather than \\nindividuals, randomization to consistent condom use compared \\nwith no condom use, and by measurement of outcomes in male \\nand female partners simultaneously.'),\n",

Holmes et al. \\nT wo methodological issues in observational studies of \\ncondom effectiveness are of particular concern: (1) underestima-\\ntion of point estimates, and (2) exposure to infected partners.\\nUnderestimates of condom effectiveness could result from \\nover-reporting of condom use by participants in order to satisfy \\nthe interviewer (known as social desirability bias). Devine & \\nAral (23) conducted simulation experiments to illustrate that \\nover-reporting of condom use reduced both the point estimate \\nof condom effectiveness and the power of the study to detect a \\nprotective effect of condom use.\\nStudies that do not adjust for the improper use of con-\\ndoms could also underestimate the effectiveness of proper use. \\n(24) For example, in a retrospective study in the United States \\namong 98 male university students selected because they had \\nused condoms during vaginal intercourse at least ﬁve or more \\ntimes, and at least once during the previous month, Warner et \\nal. (24) found that in 13% of 270 instances, condoms broke \\nor were used incorrectly; this allowed for direct penile–vaginal \\ncontact, and consequently, exposure to STIs.\\nRestricting condom effectiveness analyses to participants \\nwith known exposure to infected partners reduces confounding \\nand provides a more accurate measurement of the protective \\neffects of condoms against STIs. In a cross-sectional analysis of \\nbaseline data from Project RESPECT , Warner et al. (25) com-\\npared estimates of the effectiveness of condoms in a subsample \\nof people with known exposure (they were referred to the clinic \\nbecause their partner had gonorrhoea or chlamydial infection) \\nwith estimates in a subsample of people who visited the clinic for \\nother reasons. Among the 429 participants with known exposure, \\nthe consistent use of condoms was associated with a signiﬁcant \\nreduction in those STIs (OR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.18–0.99). \\nAmong the 4314 participants for whom exposure information \\nwas not known, the consistent use of condoms was less effective \\n(OR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.66–1.01).\\nFitch et al. (26) note the importance of differentiating \\nbetween effectiveness in single-episode use and “period effective-\\nness”. The latter measure takes into account user error, condom \\nfailure, the variable infectiousness of particular STIs, and the \\nimpact of repeated exposure. Also, it has proven far more feasible \\nto promote condom use during occasional acts of commercial \\nor casual sex than to introduce and sustain consistent condom \\nuse during repeated acts of intercourse over years among stable \\ncouples (9).\\nCrosby et al. (27) identiﬁed several potential problems \\nand solutions in condom effectiveness studies.\\n• An infection-free cohort should be established at baseline  \\n through testing and treatment of nonviral STIs. \\n• It is essential to have sample sizes that are adequate to detect  \\n a signiﬁcant impact of condom use. \\n• Using the number of unprotected sex acts is preferable to  \\n calculating the percentage of times that a condom is used,  \\n as the latter does not account for variation in frequency of  \\n intercourse.\\nIn view of these issues, it seems remarkable that data from lon-\\ngitudinal studies and the one randomized trial as well as several \\ncross-sectional or case–control studies have nonetheless demon-\\nstrated the statistically signiﬁcant effectiveness of condoms in \\nprotecting against HIV and most of the other STIs examined.\\nNot all earlier prospective observational studies found \\nthat consistent condom use was associated with a decreased \\nrisk of STIs. For example, Bunnell et al. (15) followed 484 \\nadolescents at four clinics over a six-month period and found \\nan incident STI in 21% of 61 participants reporting 100% \\ncondom use and in 23% of 423 adolescents reporting inconsis-\\ntent use or no condom use. Zenilman et al. (16) prospectively \\nstudied condom use among 598 male and female patients at \\nan STD clinic in Baltimore, Maryland. During follow-up STI \\nincidence was similar for participants reporting 100% condom \\nuse and for those reporting that they never used condoms; this \\nwas found for both male and female patients. However, when \\nspeciﬁc STI incidence was examined rather than combined STI \\nincidence, consistent condom use (as compared with sometime \\nuse or never use) was associated with a signiﬁcantly lower rate \\nof chlamydial infection in men (1, 16).\\nRecommendations for further research\\nFuture research using improved methods for ascertaining the \\nconsistency, correctness, and selectivity of condom use may lead \\nto better point estimates of effectiveness. In future trials the \\naccurate assessment of condom use will help delineate the causal \\npathway linkage of the effectiveness of STI prevention methods \\nthat do or do not include the promotion of condom use (28).\\nThe general quality of research on condom effectiveness \\nin preventing HIV and other STIs can be readily improved \\nby routinely collecting the partner-speciﬁc data in relation to \\ntesting for current STIs or incident HIV infection. Questions \\nthat should be asked include:\\n• How many times did you have sex with a particular partner  \\n during the past month? How many times were condoms not  \\n used with that partner during the past month? \\n• How many times in the past month were condoms put on  \\n after the start of intercourse? How many times were condoms  \\n removed before stopping intercourse? How many times did  \\n condoms slip off or break before intercourse ended?\\n• How many times has a particular partner had an STI in the  \\n past month? What type(s) of STI(s)?\\n• Has that particular partner had other partners during the  \\n past month? \\nCondom use is typically more common with partners perceived \\nas likely to be infected than with those not perceived as likely \\nto be infected. Collecting similar data for the past three-month \\nperiod or longer would also be useful, depending on which \\nSTI is being studied. Such information would contribute \\nto research on condom effectiveness and would strengthen \\nmonitoring and evaluation processes.\\nThe effectiveness of condom-promotion \\nprogrammes\\nThe question remains whether programmes designed to increase \\nthe frequency of condom use actually achieve increased use and \\nwhether they decrease the individual’s risk of acquiring HIV \\nand other STIs. Many studies have shown that condom-pro-\\nmotion interventions decrease self-reports of unprotected sex, \\nbut fewer have examined the impact of such programmes on \\nthe actual incidence of STIs, including HIV infection. Fewer \\nstill have done so in randomized controlled trials in which \\nparticipants were followed prospectively and speciﬁcally offered \\nSTI testing. Four individual-level or group-level randomized \\ncontrolled trials that have included condom promotion have \\nreported a reduced risk of STIs (29–31) (CB Boyer et al., un-\\npublished data presented at the 15th Biennial Congress of the \\nInternational Society for Sexually T ransmitted Diseases Research, \\nOttawa, 2003).'),\n",

Holmes et al.   Effectiveness of condoms in preventing STIs \\nProject RESPECT , a multisite, individual-level random-\\nized controlled trial involving 5700 heterosexual, HIV-negative \\npatients at public STI clinics in the United States found that \\ninteractive, client-centred HIV and STI risk reduction coun-\\nselling that emphasized avoiding unprotected sex resulted in \\nmore frequent reports of 100% condom use and a statistically \\nsigniﬁcant 20% lower incidence of STIs over 12 months of \\nfollow-up when compared with counselling that used only \\ndidactic prevention messages (29).\\nIn a group-level -randomized trial, Shain et al. (30) found \\nthat enhanced counselling, which included three intensive, \\nsmall-group sessions for female Hispanic and African-American \\npatients at an STI clinic resulted in a lower incidence of gonor-\\nrhoea and chlamydial infection over the following year when  \\ncompared with standard counselling. The sessions were based \\non ethnographic research; the sessions for Hispanic women \\nwere similar to those for African-American women, but there \\nwere some differences in emphasis. The effect of the intervention \\nappeared to be mediated by a number of behavioural changes \\nincluding increased condom use (32). T wo other group-level \\nrandomized trials involving women also showed efﬁcacy in \\npreventing STIs (31, CB Boyer et al. unpublished data). \\nA randomized trial of voluntary HIV testing and counsel-\\nling in Kenya, the United Republic of Tanzania and T rinidad \\nbetween 1995 and 1998 (33), which was modelled on the \\nProject RESPECT intervention, compared client-centred \\ncounselling with giving health information alone. It found \\nthere was a decrease in the incidence of unprotected intercourse \\nwith non-regular partners among those who had counselling. \\nThere was also a reduction of about 20% in new STIs which \\nwas similar to that seen in Project RESPECT but not statisti-\\ncally signiﬁcant in this underpowered study.\\nIn a ﬁeld trial in Thailand involving nonrandomized but \\ncomparable groups of army conscripts, Celentano et al. ( 34) \\nfound that groups participating in a multicomponent HIV and \\nSTI prevention intervention that lasted for several months and \\ncontained a condom promotion component had 80% fewer \\nincident STIs when compared with the control groups.\\nFinally, a London-based group-randomized trial of a \\none-day cognitive behavioural intervention designed to reduce \\nSTI incidence among men who have sex with men had dif -\\nferent results (35). The intervention group reported a modest \\ndecrease in the incidence of unprotected anal intercourse but \\nactually experienced a signiﬁcantly increased risk of new STIs \\nin comparison with the control group. This study illustrates the \\nimportance of measuring objective STI outcomes rather than \\nrelying only on self-reported changes in behaviour.\\nThus, as with prospective studies of condom efﬁcacy, not \\nall harm-reduction interventions that include condom promotion \\nhave succeeded in reducing STI morbidity. Success undoubt-\\nedly depends on the intervention and the context, among other \\nfactors. Nonetheless, adequately powered studies (i.e., those \\nhaving large enough sample sizes) that examined heterosexual \\npopulations have consistently shown a signiﬁcant impact on \\nsubsequent STI outcomes when such outcomes have been \\nmeasured.\\nConclusions\\nSince 2000 important new evidence (from prospective obser-\\nvational studies, one couple-randomized trial and additional \\nmulticomponent STI prevention trials that included condom-\\npromotion components) has come to light to support the ef-\\nfectiveness of condoms in preventing STIs in men and women. \\nIn no study has the effectiveness been 100%. Nonetheless, \\neven partially effective interventions can have a major impact \\non controlling the spread of STIs in the population (36). Bal-\\nanced STI and HIV prevention programmes should include \\ncondom promotion along with a complementary combination \\nof prevention strategies targeted towards different age groups, \\nlife stages, epidemic levels, and settings (37, 38). Condom pro-\\nmotion represents an important component of comprehensive \\nHIV-prevention and STI-prevention strategies.

El estudio \\nconcluyó que los preservativos protegían eﬁcazmente contra el \\nVIH a hombres y mujeres y reducían el riesgo de que los hombres \\ncontrajeran gonorrea. No obstante, se consideró insuﬁciente \\nla evidencia sobre la eﬁcacia del preservativo como medio de \\nprevención de otras ITS. Hemos examinado aquí los resultados de \\nestudios prospectivos publicados con posterioridad a junio de 2000 \\nen los que se evaluó la eﬁcacia de los preservativos como método \\nde prevención de las ITS. Buscamos en MEDLINE publicaciones \\nen inglés, y añadimos otros artículos, informes y resúmenes que \\nconocíamos. Estos estudios prospectivos, publicados después de \\njunio de 2000, revelan que el uso de preservativos se asocia a una \\nprotección estadísticamente signiﬁcativa de hombres y mujeres \\nfrente a otros varios tipos de ITS, incluidas las infecciones por \\nclamidias, la gonorrea, el virus herpes simple tipo 2  y la síﬁlis. \\nLos preservativos también pueden proteger a las mujeres contra \\nla tricomoniasis. Si bien ninguno de los estudios prospectivos \\npublicados ha revelado un efecto de protección contra la infección \\npor el papilomavirus humano (VPH), en dos estudios se observó que \\nel uso del preservativo se asociaba a mayores tasas de regresión \\nde las neoplasias intraepiteliales cervicouterinas y de desaparición \\nde la infección cervicouterina por VPH en las mujeres, así como \\nde regresión de las lesiones de pene por VPH en los hombres.

These guidelines discuss 1) updated recommendations for treatment of \\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and T richomonas vaginalis; 2) addition of metronidazole to the recommended \\ntreatment regimen for pelvic inflammatory disease; 3) alternative treatment options for bacterial vaginosis; 4) management of \\nMycoplasma genitalium; 5) human papillomavirus vaccine recommendations and counseling messages; 6) expanded risk factors \\nfor syphilis testing among pregnant women; 7) one-time testing for hepatitis C infection; 8) evaluation of men who have sex with \\nmen after sexual assault; and 9) two-step testing for serologic diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus. Physicians and other health \\ncare providers can use these guidelines to assist in prevention and treatment of STIs.\\nIntroduction\\nThe term “sexually transmitted infection” (STI) refers to \\na pathogen that causes infection through sexual contact, \\nwhereas the term “sexually transmitted disease” (STD) refers \\nto a recognizable disease state that has developed from an \\ninfection. Physicians and other health care providers have a \\ncrucial role in preventing and treating STIs. These guidelines \\nare intended to assist with that effort. Although the guidelines \\nemphasize treatment, prevention strategies and diagnostic \\nrecommendations also are discussed.\\nThis report updates Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment \\nGuidelines, 2015 (1) and should be regarded as a source of \\nclinical guidance rather than prescriptive standards. Health care \\nproviders should always consider the clinical circumstances of \\neach person in the context of local disease prevalence. These \\nguidelines are applicable to any patient care setting that serves \\npersons at risk for STIs, including family planning clinics, \\nHIV care clinics, correctional health care settings, private \\nphysicians’ offices, Federally Qualified Health Centers, clinics \\nfor adolescent care, and other primary care facilities. These \\nguidelines are focused on treatment and counseling and do \\nnot address other community services and interventions that \\nare essential to STI and HIV prevention efforts.\\nThese STI treatment guidelines complement Recommendations \\nfor Providing Quality Sexually Transmitted Diseases Clinical \\nServices, 2020 (2) regarding quality clinical services for STIs \\nin primary care and STD specialty care settings. This guidance \\nspecifies operational determinants of quality services in various \\nclinical settings, describes on-site treatment and partner \\nservices, and indicates when STI-related conditions should be \\nmanaged through consultation with or referral to a specialist.\\nMethods\\nThese guidelines were developed by CDC staff who worked \\nwith subject matter experts with expertise in STI clinical \\nmanagement from other federal agencies, nongovernmental \\nacademic and research institutions, and professional medical \\norganizations. CDC staff identified governmental and \\nnongovernmental subject matter experts on the basis of their \\nexpertise and assisted them in developing questions to guide \\nindividual literature reviews. CDC staff informed the subject \\nmatter experts that they were being consulted to exchange \\ninformation and observations and to obtain their individual \\ninput. All subject matter experts disclosed potential conflicts \\nof interest. STI T reatment Guidelines, 2021, Work Group \\nmembers are listed at the end of this report.\\nIn 2018, CDC staff identified key questions about treatment \\nand clinical management to guide an update of the 2015 \\nSTD treatment guidelines (1). T o answer these questions \\nand synthesize new information available since publication \\nof the 2015 guidelines, subject matter experts and CDC staff'),\n",

These \\nsystematic reviews were focused on four principal outcomes \\nof STI therapy for each disease or infection: 1) treatment \\nof infection on the basis of microbiologic eradication; \\n2) alleviation of signs and symptoms; 3) prevention of sequelae; \\nand 4) prevention of transmission, including advantages (e.g., \\ncost-effectiveness, single-dose formulations, and directly \\nobserved therapy) and disadvantages (e.g., adverse effects) \\nof specific regimens. The outcome of the literature reviews \\nguided development of background materials, including tables \\nof evidence from peer-reviewed publications summarizing \\nthe type of study (e.g., randomized controlled trial or case \\nseries), study population and setting, treatments or other \\ninterventions, outcome measures assessed, reported findings, \\nand weaknesses and biases in study design and analysis.\\nIn June 2019, the subject matter experts presented their \\nassessments of the literature reviews at an in-person meeting \\nof governmental and nongovernmental participants. Each \\nkey question was discussed and pertinent publications were \\nreviewed in terms of strengths, weaknesses, and relevance. \\nParticipants evaluated the quality of evidence, provided their \\ninput, and discussed findings in the context of the modified \\nrating system used by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \\n(USPSTF). The discussions were informal and not structured \\nto reach consensus. CDC staff also reviewed the publications \\nfrom other professional organizations, including the American \\nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), USPSTF , \\nthe American Cancer Society (ACS), the American Society \\nfor Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP), and the \\nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). \\nThe discussion culminated in a list of participants’ opinions \\non all the key STI topic areas for consideration by CDC. \\n(More detailed descriptions of the key questions, search terms, \\nsystematic search, evidence tables, and review process are \\navailable at https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/\\ndefault.htm).\\nCDC staff then independently reviewed the tables of evidence \\nprepared by the subject matter experts, individual comments \\nfrom the participants and professional organizations, and existing \\nguidelines from other organizations to determine whether \\nrevisions to the 2015 STD treatment guidelines were warranted. \\nCDC staff ranked evidence as high, medium, and low on the \\nbasis of each study’s strengths and weaknesses according to the \\nUSPSTF ratings (https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.\\norg/uspstf/us-preventive-services-task-force-ratings). CDC staff \\nthen developed draft recommendations that were peer reviewed \\nby public health and clinical experts as defined by the Office of \\nManagement and Budget for influential scientific information. \\nA public webinar was held to provide an overview of the draft \\nrecommendations and invite questions and comments on the \\ndraft recommendations. The peer review comments, webinar, \\nquestions, and responses were considered by CDC staff in \\ndeveloping the final recommendations for the updated STI \\ntreatment guidelines. Recommendations for HIV , hepatitis C, \\ncervical cancer screening, STI screening in pregnancy, human \\npapillomavirus (HPV) testing, and hepatitis A virus (HAV) and \\nhepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination were developed after CDC \\nstaff reviewed existing published recommendations. The English-\\nlanguage literature was searched periodically by CDC staff to \\nidentify subsequently published articles warranting consideration.\\nThroughout this report, the evidence used as the basis for \\nspecific recommendations is discussed briefly. Publication \\nof comprehensive, annotated discussions of such evidence \\nis planned in a supplemental issue of the journal Clinical \\nInfectious Diseases after publication of the treatment guidelines. \\nWhen more than one therapeutic regimen is recommended \\nand the listed regimens have similar efficacy and similar \\nrates of intolerance or toxicity, the recommendations are \\nlisted alphabetically. If differences are specified, regimens are \\nprioritized on the basis of these differences. Recommended \\nregimens should be used primarily; alternative regimens can be \\nconsidered in instances of notable drug allergy or other medical \\ncontraindications to the recommended regimens. Alternative \\nregimens are considered inferior to recommended regimens on \\nthe basis of available evidence regarding the principal outcomes \\nand disadvantages of the regimens.\\nClinical Prevention Guidance\\nPrevention and control of STIs are based on the following \\nfive major strategies (3):\\n1. Accurate risk assessment and education and counseling \\nof persons at risk regarding ways to avoid STIs through \\nchanges in sexual behaviors and use of recommended \\nprevention services\\n2. Pre-exposure vaccination for vaccine-preventable STIs\\n3. Identification of persons with an asymptomatic \\ninfection and persons with symptoms associated with \\nan STI\\n4. Effective diagnosis, treatment, counseling, and follow-\\nup of persons who are infected with an STI\\n5.

Effective techniques for facilitating rapport with \\npatients include using open-ended questions (e.g., “T ell me \\nabout any new sex partners you’ve had since your last visit” and \\n“What has your experience with using condoms been like?”); \\nunderstandable, nonjudgmental language (e.g., “What gender \\nare your sex partners?” and “Have you ever had a sore or scab \\non your penis?”); and normalizing language (e.g., “Some of my \\npatients have difficulty using a condom with every sex act. How \\nis it for you?”). The “Five P’s” approach to obtaining a sexual \\nhistory is one strategy for eliciting information about the key \\nareas of interest (Box 1). In addition, health care professionals \\ncan consider assessing sexual history by asking patients such \\nquestions as, “Do you have any questions or concerns about \\nyour sexual health?” Additional information about gaining \\ncultural competency when working with certain populations \\n(e.g., gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men \\n[MSM]; women who have sex with women [WSW] or with \\nwomen and men [WSWM]; or transgender men and women \\nor adolescents) is available in sections of these guidelines related \\nto these populations.\\nIn addition to obtaining a behavioral risk assessment, a \\ncomprehensive STI and HIV risk assessment should include \\nSTI screening as recommended in these guidelines because \\nSTIs are biologic markers of risk, particularly for HIV \\nacquisition and transmission among certain MSM. In most \\nclinical settings, STI screening is an essential and underused \\ncomponent of an STI and HIV risk assessment. Persons \\nseeking treatment or evaluation for a particular STI should be \\nscreened for HIV and other STIs as indicated by community \\nprevalence and individual risk factors (see Chlamydial \\nInfections; Gonococcal Infections; Syphilis). Persons should \\nbe informed about all the tests for STIs they are receiving and \\nnotified about tests for common STIs (e.g., genital herpes, \\nBOX 1.

Persons should be informed of their test \\nresults and recommendations for future testing. Efforts should \\nbe made to ensure that all persons receive STI care regardless \\nof personal circumstances (e.g., ability to pay, citizenship \\nor immigration status, gender identity, language spoken, or \\nspecific sex practices).\\nSTI and HIV Infection \\nPrevention Counseling\\nAfter obtaining a sexual history from their patients, all \\nproviders should encourage risk reduction by offering \\nprevention counseling. Prevention counseling is most effective \\nif provided in a nonjudgmental and empathetic manner \\nappropriate to the patient’s culture, language, sex and gender \\nidentity, sexual orientation, age, and developmental level. \\nPrevention counseling for STIs and HIV should be offered \\nto all sexually active adolescents and to all adults who have \\nreceived an STI diagnosis, have had an STI during the \\nprevious year, or have had multiple sex partners. USPSTF \\nrecommends intensive behavioral counseling for all sexually \\nactive adolescents and for adults at increased risk for STIs and \\nHIV (4). Such interactive counseling, which can be resource \\nintensive, is directed at a person’s risk, the situations in which \\nrisk occurs, and the use of personalized goal-setting strategies. \\nOne such approach, known as client-centered STI and HIV \\nprevention counseling, involves tailoring a discussion of risk \\nreduction to the person’s situation. Although one large study in \\nSTI clinics (Project RESPECT) demonstrated that this approach \\nwas associated with lower acquisition of curable STIs (e.g., \\ntrichomoniasis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis) (5), another \\nstudy conducted 10 years later in the same settings but different \\ncontexts (Project AWARE) did not replicate this result (6).\\nWith the challenges that intensive behavioral counseling poses, \\nhealth care professionals might find brief prevention messages \\nand those delivered through video or in a group session to be \\nmore accessible for the client. A review of 11 studies evaluated \\nbrief prevention messages delivered by providers and health \\ncounselors and reported them to be feasible and to decrease \\nsubsequent STIs in STD clinic settings (7) and HIV care \\nsettings (8). Other approaches use motivational interviewing \\nto move clients toward achievable risk-reduction goals. Client-\\ncentered counseling and motivational interviewing can be used \\neffectively by clinicians and staff trained in these approaches. \\nCDC provides additional information on these and other \\neffective behavioral interventions at https://www.cdc.gov/\\nstd/program/interventions.htm . T raining in client-centered \\ncounseling and motivational interviewing is available through \\nthe STD National Network of Prevention T raining Centers \\n(https://www.nnptc.org).\\nIn addition to one-on-one STI and HIV prevention \\ncounseling, videos and large group presentations can provide \\nexplicit information concerning STIs and reducing disease \\ntransmission (e.g., how to use condoms consistently and \\ncorrectly and the importance of routine screening). Group-\\nbased strategies have been effective in reducing the occurrence \\nof STIs among persons at risk, including those attending STD \\nclinics (9). Brief, online, electronic-learning modules for young \\nMSM have been reported to be effective in reducing incident \\nSTIs and offer a convenient client platform for effective \\ninterventions (10). Because the incidence of certain STIs, \\nmost notably syphilis, is higher among persons with HIV \\ninfection, use of client-centered STI counseling for persons \\nwith HIV continues to be encouraged by public health agencies \\nand other health organizations (https://www.cdc.gov/std/\\nstatistics/2019/default.htm). A 2014 guideline from CDC, \\nthe Health Resources and Services Administration, and the \\nNational Institutes of Health recommends that clinical and \\nnonclinical providers assess a person’s behavioral and biologic \\nrisks for acquiring or transmitting STIs and HIV , including \\nhaving sex without condoms, having recent STIs, and having \\npartners recently treated for STIs (https://stacks.cdc.gov/\\nview/cdc/44064). That federal guideline is for clinical and \\nnonclinical providers to offer or make referral for regular \\nscreening for multiple STIs, on-site STI treatment when \\nindicated, and risk-reduction interventions tailored to the \\nperson’s risks. Brief risk-reduction counseling delivered by \\nmedical providers during HIV primary care visits, coupled \\nwith routine STI screening, has been reported to reduce STI \\nincidence among persons with HIV infection (8). Other \\nspecific methods have been designed for the HIV care setting \\n(https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/effective-interventions/index.html).\\nPrimary Prevention Methods\\nPre-Exposure Vaccination\\nPre-exposure vaccination is one of the most effective methods \\nfor preventing transmission of HPV , HAV , and HBV , all \\nof which can be sexually transmitted. HPV vaccination is \\nrecommended routinely for males and females aged 11 or \\n12 years and can be administered beginning at age 9 years. \\nHPV vaccination is recommended through age 26 years for \\nthose not previously vaccinated (11). Sharing clinical decision-\\nmaking about HPV vaccination is recommended for certain \\nadults aged 27–45 years who are not adequately vaccinated \\nin accordance with existing guidance (https://www.cdc.gov/\\nvaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html).'),\n",

HAV vaccine is \\nalso recommended for persons who are homeless (13). Details \\nregarding HAV and HBV vaccination, including routine \\nchildhood vaccination, are available at https://www.cdc.gov/\\nhepatitis and at the ACIP website ( https://www.cdc.gov/\\nvaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/index.html).\\nCondoms\\nExternal Condoms\\nWhen used consistently and correctly, external latex \\ncondoms, also known as male condoms, are effective in \\npreventing the sexual transmission of HIV infection (http://\\nwww.ashasexualhealth.org/pdfs/Male_and_Female_Condoms.\\npdf). In heterosexual HIV mixed-status relationships (i.e., those \\ninvolving one infected and one uninfected partner) in which \\ncondoms were used consistently, HIV-negative partners were \\n71%–80% less likely to become infected with HIV , compared \\nwith persons in similar relationships in which condoms were \\nnot used (14,15). T wo analyses of MSM mixed-status couple \\nstudies estimated the protective effect of condom use to be 70% \\nand 91%, respectively (16,17). Moreover, studies demonstrate \\nthat consistent condom use reduces the risk for other STIs, \\nincluding chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and trichomoniasis \\n(18–21). By limiting lower genital tract infections, condoms \\nalso might reduce the risk for pelvic inflammatory disease \\n(PID) among women (22). In addition, consistent and correct \\nuse of latex condoms reduces the risk for HPV infection \\nand HPV-associated diseases, genital herpes, syphilis, and \\nchancroid when the infected area or site of potential exposure \\nis covered (23–27). Additional information is available at \\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/index.html  and \\nwww.factsaboutcondoms.com/professional.php . Condoms \\nare regulated as medical devices and are subject to random \\nsampling and testing by the Food and Drug Administration \\n(FDA). Each latex condom manufactured in the United States \\nis tested electronically for holes before packaging. The rate of \\ncondom breakage during sexual intercourse and withdrawal in \\nthe United States is approximately two broken condoms per \\n100 condoms. Rates of breakage and slippage might be slightly \\nhigher during anal intercourse (28,29). The failure of condoms \\nto protect against STIs or unintended pregnancy usually results \\nfrom inconsistent or incorrect use rather than condom breakage \\n(30). Users should check the expiration or manufacture date \\non the box or individual package. Latex condoms should not \\nbe used beyond their expiration date or >5 years after the \\nmanufacturing date. Condoms made of materials other than \\nlatex are available in the United States and can be classified \\ninto two general categories: 1) polyurethane, polyisoprene, or \\nother synthetic condoms and 2) natural membrane condoms.\\nPolyurethane external condoms provide protection against \\nSTIs and HIV and pregnancy comparable to that of latex \\ncondoms (20,31). These can be substituted for latex condoms \\nby persons with latex sensitivity, are typically more resistant to \\ndeterioration, and are compatible with use of both oil-based \\nand water-based lubricants. The effectiveness of other synthetic \\nexternal condoms to prevent STIs has not been extensively \\nstudied, and FDA labeling restricts their recommended use \\nto persons who are sensitive to or allergic to latex. Natural \\nmembrane condoms (frequently called natural skin condoms \\nor [incorrectly] lambskin condoms) are made from lamb cecum \\nand can have pores up to 1,500 nm in diameter. Although \\nthese pores do not allow the passage of sperm, they are more \\nthan 10 times the diameter of HIV and more than 25 times \\nthat of HBV . Moreover, laboratory studies demonstrate that \\nsexual transmission of viruses, including HBV , herpes simplex \\nvirus (HSV), and HIV , can occur with natural membrane \\ncondoms (31). Therefore, natural membrane condoms are not \\nrecommended for prevention of STIs and HIV .\\nProviders should advise that condoms must be used \\nconsistently and correctly to be effective in preventing STIs and \\nHIV while noting that any condom use is better than no condom \\nuse. Providing instructions about the correct use of condoms \\ncan be useful. Communicating the following recommendations \\ncan help ensure that patients use external condoms correctly:\\n• Use a new condom with each sex act (i.e., oral, vaginal, \\nand anal).\\n• Carefully handle the condom to avoid damaging it with \\nfingernails, teeth, or other sharp objects.\\n• Put the condom on after the penis is erect and before any \\ngenital, oral, or anal contact with the partner.\\n• Use only water-based or silicone-based lubricants (e.g., \\nK-Y Jelly, Astroglide, AquaLube, or glycerin) with latex \\ncondoms. Oil-based lubricants (e.g., petroleum jelly, \\nshortening, mineral oil, massage oils, body lotions, or \\ncooking oil) can weaken latex and should not be used; \\nhowever, oil-based lubricants typically can be used with \\npolyurethane or other synthetic condoms.\\n• Ensure adequate lubrication during vaginal and anal sex, \\nwhich might require using exogenous water-based \\nlubricants.\\n• Hold the condom firmly against the base of the penis \\nduring withdrawal, and withdraw while the penis is still \\nerect to prevent the condom from slipping off.'),\n",

Use of internal condoms can provide \\nprotection from acquisition and transmission of STIs, although \\ndata are limited. Internal condoms are more costly compared \\nwith external condoms; however, they offer the advantage of \\nbeing controlled by the receptive partner as an STI and HIV \\nprevention method, and the newer versions might be acceptable \\nto all persons. Although the internal condom also has been used \\nduring receptive anal intercourse, efficacy associated with this \\npractice remains unknown (33). Additional information about \\nthe internal condom is available at http://www.ashasexualhealth.\\norg/pdfs/Male_and_Female_Condoms.pdf.\\nCervical Diaphragms\\nIn observational studies, diaphragm use has been \\ndemonstrated to protect against cervical gonorrhea, chlamydia, \\nand trichomoniasis (34). However, a trial examining the effect \\nof a diaphragm plus lubricant on HIV acquisition among \\nwomen in Africa reported no additional protective effect when \\ncompared with the use of male condoms alone. Likewise, no \\ndifference by study arm in the rate of acquisition of chlamydia, \\ngonorrhea, or herpes occurred (35,36). Diaphragms should \\nnot be relied on as the sole source of protection against HIV \\nand other STIs.\\nMultipurpose Prevention Technologies\\nMethods that combine STI and HIV prevention \\nwith pregnancy prevention are known as multipurpose \\nprevention technologies (MPTs) (37) (https://www.who.int/\\nreproductivehealth/topics/linkages/mpts/en). Internal and \\nexternal condoms are both examples of MPTs because they are \\neffective prevention measures when used correctly for STI and \\nHIV transmission or pregnancy prevention. The multicenter \\nEvidence for Contraception Options and HIV Outcomes \\n(ECHO) trial observed no statistically significant differences in \\nHIV incidence rates among women randomly assigned to one \\nof three contraceptive methods (depot medroxyprogesterone \\nacetate [DMPA], levonorgestrel implant, and copper-\\ncontaining intrauterine device [IUD]); however, rates of HIV \\ninfection were high in all groups, indicating a need for MPTs \\n(38). Development of MPTs is complex and ongoing; products \\nunder study include microbicides with contraceptive devices \\n(e.g., tenofovir with a vaginal ring contraceptive delivery \\npackage) and other innovative methods (39).\\nTopical Microbicides and Spermicides\\nNonspecific topical microbicides are ineffective for \\npreventing HIV infection ( 40–45). T enofovir gel has been \\nstudied for prevention of herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) \\nand HIV infections (46,47). Adherence can be low (48), and \\nprevention of HIV infection, especially among women, has not \\nbeen demonstrated (47,49).Vaginal rings containing dapivirine \\nhave provided some reduction in HIV infection (50,51). For \\nmen and transgender women who have anal intercourse, \\ntenofovir gel appears safe when applied before and after anal \\nsex (52). Spermicides containing nonoxynol-9 (N-9) might \\ndisrupt genital or rectal epithelium and have been associated \\nwith an increased risk for HIV infection. Condoms with N-9 \\nare no more effective than condoms without N-9; therefore, \\nN-9 alone or in a condom is not recommended for STI and \\nHIV prevention (40). N-9 use also has been associated with \\nan increased risk for bacterial urinary tract infections among \\nwomen (53,54).\\nNonbarrier Contraception, Female Surgical \\nSterilization, and Hysterectomy\\nContraceptive methods that are not mechanical barriers \\noffer no protection against HIV or other STIs. The ECHO \\nstudy observed no differences in HIV incidence rates among \\nwomen randomly assigned to DMPA, levonorgestrel implant, \\nor copper-containing IUD contraceptive methods (38). A \\nsystematic review of epidemiologic evidence reported that the \\nmajority of studies demonstrated no association between use \\nof oral contraceptives and HIV acquisition among women \\n(55). Whether hormonal contraception alters a woman’s risk \\nfor other STIs is uncertain (56,57).\\nSexually active women who use contraceptive methods \\nother than condoms should be counseled about STI and HIV \\ninfection prevention measures. These include pre-exposure \\nprophylaxis (PrEP) and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), \\nlimiting the number of sex partners, and correct and consistent \\nuse of condoms.\\nEmergency Contraception\\nUnprotected intercourse exposes women to risks for STIs \\nand unplanned pregnancy. Providers should offer counseling \\nabout the option of emergency contraception if pregnancy \\nis not desired. Options for emergency contraception in the \\nUnited States include copper-containing IUDs and emergency \\ncontraceptive pills (ECPs) (58,59).

An advance supply of ECPs can be provided or prescribed \\nso that ECPs will be available when needed (59).\\nMale Circumcision\\nMale circumcision reduces the risk for HIV infection and \\ncertain STIs among heterosexual men. Three randomized, \\ncontrolled trials performed in regions of sub-Saharan Africa, \\nwhere generalized HIV epidemics involving predominantly \\nheterosexual transmission were occurring, demonstrated that \\nmale circumcision reduces the risk for HIV acquisition among \\nmen by 50%–60% (63–65). In those trials, circumcision \\nalso was protective against other STIs, including high-risk \\ngenital HPV infection and genital herpes (66–68). Follow-up \\nstudies have demonstrated sustained benefit of circumcision \\nfor HIV prevention (69) and that the effect is not mediated \\nsolely through a reduction in HSV-2 infection or genital ulcer \\ndisease (GUD) (70).\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint \\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) \\nrecommend that male circumcision efforts be scaled up as an \\neffective intervention for preventing heterosexually acquired HIV \\ninfection (71) in countries with hyperendemic and generalized \\nHIV epidemics within the context of ensuring universal access \\nto comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support \\n(https://www.afro.who.int/publications/voluntary-medical-male-\\ncircumcision-hiv-prevention). In the United States, the American \\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that newborn male \\ncircumcision be available to families that desire it because the \\nbenefits of the procedure, including prevention of penile cancers, \\nurinary tract infections, GUD, and HIV infection, outweigh the \\nrisks. ACOG has also endorsed AAP’s policy statement. In light \\nof these benefits, the American Urological Association states \\nthat male circumcision should be considered an option for risk \\nreduction, among other strategies (72). Additional information \\nfor providers counseling male patients and parents regarding \\nmale circumcision for preventing HIV , STIs, and other adverse \\nhealth outcomes is available at https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/\\nmale-circumcision.html.\\nNo definitive data exist to determine whether male \\ncircumcision reduces HIV acquisition among MSM, although \\none meta-analysis of 62 observational studies reported that \\ncircumcision was protective against HIV acquisition in low- to \\nmiddle-income countries but not in high-income countries \\n(73). Further studies are needed to confirm any potential \\nbenefit of male circumcision for this population.\\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV\\nDaily oral antiretroviral PrEP with a fixed-dose combination \\nof emtricitabine (FTC) and either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate \\n(TDF) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) have demonstrated \\nsafety (74) and a substantial reduction in the rate of HIV \\nacquisition for MSM ( 75). TDF/FTC has demonstrated \\nsafety and efficacy for mixed-status heterosexual couples (76) \\nand heterosexual men and women recruited individually \\n(77); however, no evidence is yet available regarding TAF/\\nFTC among heterosexually active women. In addition, one \\nclinical trial involving persons who inject drugs (78) and one \\ninvolving heterosexual mixed-status couples (76) demonstrated \\nsubstantial efficacy and safety of daily oral PrEP with TDF \\nalone. High adherence to oral PrEP was strongly associated \\nwith protection from HIV infection. Studies conducted with \\nMSM have demonstrated that taking PrEP at specific times \\nbefore and after sexual intercourse was effective in preventing \\nHIV; however, less experience exits with this regimen, it is \\nnot FDA cleared, and it has not been studied among other \\npopulations (79).\\nComprehensive clinical practice guidelines are available \\nfor providers in prescribing PrEP to reduce the risk for HIV \\ninfection (80). Among HIV-negative sexually active men \\nand women, bacterial STIs are key indicators of risk for \\nHIV acquisition.

The USPSTF recommends that persons at risk \\nfor HIV acquisition be offered PrEP (84). Persons at risk for \\nHIV acquisition include HIV-negative persons whose sexual \\npartner or partners have HIV infection (especially if viral load \\nis detectable or unknown), persons who have had gonorrhea \\nor syphilis during the previous 6 months, and injecting drug \\nusers who share injection equipment (84). Clinical practice \\nguidelines recommend STI screening for persons taking PrEP \\n(80) because increased rates of STI acquisition have been \\ndescribed (85–87).\\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis for STIs\\nProviding HSV treatment to persons with HIV and HSV \\ninfection has not demonstrated benefit in reducing HIV \\nacquisition among uninfected partners. A large randomized \\ncontrolled trial evaluated mixed-status heterosexual couples \\namong the partners with HIV infection who also were \\nseropositive for HSV-2 (88). Use of acyclovir had no effect \\non HIV transmission. These findings are consistent with a \\nprevious trial that reported no benefit of acyclovir in preventing \\nHIV acquisition among persons seropositive for HSV-2 (89).\\nDoxycycline prophylaxis has been examined for preventing \\nbacterial STIs. In a pilot study, 30 MSM living with HIV with \\nprevious syphilis (two or more episodes since HIV diagnosis) \\nwere randomly assigned to doxycycline 100 mg for 48 weeks \\nversus a financial incentive–based behavioral intervention (90). \\nThat study demonstrated a 73% reduction in any bacterial STI \\nat any site, without substantial differences in sexual behavior. \\nAdditional studies examining doxycycline prophylaxis are \\nunder way or in development (91).\\nPostexposure Prophylaxis for HIV and STIs\\nGuidelines for using PEP aimed at preventing HIV and other \\nSTIs as a result of sexual exposure are available at https://www.\\ncdc.gov/hiv/pdf/programresources/cdc-hiv-npep-guidelines.\\npdf. Sexually active persons seeking HIV PEP should be \\nevaluated for PrEP after completing their PEP course and \\ntesting negative for HIV . HIV PEP is also discussed elsewhere \\nin this report (see Sexual Assault and Abuse and STIs). Genital \\nhygiene methods (e.g., vaginal washing and douching) after \\nsexual exposure are ineffective in protecting against HIV and \\nSTIs and might increase the risk for bacterial vaginosis (BV), \\ncertain STIs, and HIV infection (92).\\nSTI PEP in the form of doxycycline 200 mg taken after \\nunprotected anal sex has been studied among MSM and \\ntransgender women; results demonstrated reduction in incident \\nchlamydia and syphilis by 70% and 73%, respectively, but no \\neffect on gonorrhea (93). Other studies are under way or in \\ndevelopment regarding doxycycline prophylaxis for bacterial \\nSTIs (91). No long-term data are available regarding the impact \\nof STI PEP on antimicrobial resistance and the microbiome. \\nFurther studies are needed to determine whether STI PEP is \\nan effective and beneficial strategy for STI prevention.\\nHIV Treatment as Prevention: Antiretroviral \\nTreatment of Persons with HIV to Prevent HIV \\nAmong Partners\\nIn 2011, the randomized controlled trial HPTN 052 \\ndemonstrated that, among HIV mixed-status heterosexual \\ncouples, HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the infected \\npartner decreased the risk for transmission to the uninfected \\npartner by 96% (94). Therefore, ART not only is beneficial to \\nthe health of persons with HIV infection, it also reduces the \\nrisk for transmission. Additional studies of HIV mixed-status \\ncouples, heterosexual and MSM couples (PARTNER study), \\nand MSM couples (Opposites Attract and PARTNERS2 \\nstudies) reported that patients with HIV taking ART who \\nmaintain an undetectable viral load demonstrate no risk for \\ntransmitting HIV to their HIV-negative sex partners (95–97). \\nFor those reasons, ART should be offered to all persons with \\nHIV infection to obtain viral suppression. Detailed guidance \\nregarding ART regimens is available in the U.S. Department of \\nHealth and Human Services’ HIV treatment guidelines (98).\\nHIV Seroadaptive Strategies\\nSeroadaptive strategies for HIV prevention have largely \\noriginated within communities of MSM. They are predicated \\non knowledge of self and partner HIV status. One specific \\nseroadaptive practice is serosorting, which includes limiting \\nanal sex without a condom to partners with the same HIV \\nstatus as their own or choosing to selectively use condoms \\nwith HIV mixed-status partners. Another practice among \\nmixed-status couples is seropositioning, in which the \\nperson with HIV infection is the receptive partner for anal \\nintercourse. Observational studies have consistently reported \\nthat serosorting confers greater risk for HIV infection than \\nconsistent condom use but has lower risk compared with anal \\nintercourse without a condom and without serosorting (99–\\n101). Serosorting practices have been associated with increased \\nrisk for STIs, including chlamydia and gonorrhea (102,103).\\nSerosorting is not recommended for the following reasons: \\nmany MSM who have HIV infection do not know they \\nhave HIV because they have not been tested recently, men’s \\nassumptions about the HIV status of their partners might be \\nwrong, and some men with HIV infection might not disclose or \\nmight misrepresent their HIV status. All of these factors increase'),\n",

For persons who are being treated \\nfor an STI (or whose partners are undergoing treatment), \\ncounseling that encourages abstinence from sexual intercourse \\nuntil completion of the entire course of medication is vital \\nfor preventing reinfection. A trial conducted among women \\nregarding the effectiveness of counseling messages when \\npatients have cervicitis or vaginal discharge demonstrated \\nthat women whose sex partners have used condoms might \\nbenefit from a hierarchical message that includes condoms \\nbut women without such experience might benefit more from \\nan abstinence-only message (104). A more comprehensive \\ndiscussion of abstinence and other sexual practices that can help \\npersons reduce their risk for STIs is available in Contraceptive \\nT echnology, 21st Edition (31).\\nPartner Services\\nThe term “partner services” refers to a continuum of clinical \\nevaluation, counseling, diagnostic testing, and treatment \\ndesigned to increase the number of infected persons brought to \\ntreatment and to reduce transmission among sexual networks. \\nThis continuum includes efforts of health departments, \\nmedical providers, and patients themselves. The term “public \\nhealth partner services” refers to efforts by public health \\ndepartments to identify the sex and needle-sharing partners \\nof infected persons to ensure their medical evaluation and \\ntreatment. Health departments are increasingly incorporating \\nreferral to additional services, as indicated, into the partner services \\ncontinuum. Aside from the general benefit to patients and partners, \\nservice referrals and linkage can mitigate the circumstances that \\nincrease risk for future STI and HIV acquisition.\\nThe types and comprehensiveness of public health partner \\nservices and the specific STIs for which they are offered vary \\nby public health agency, their resources, and the geographic \\nprevalence of STIs. In most areas of the United States, health \\ndepartments routinely attempt to provide partner services to \\nall persons with infectious syphilis (primary or secondary) \\nand persons with a new diagnosis of HIV infection. Health \\ndepartments should provide partner services for persons who \\nmight have cephalosporin-resistant gonorrhea. In contrast, \\nrelatively few U.S. health departments routinely provide \\nSTI partner services to persons with gonorrhea, chlamydia, \\ntrichomoniasis, or other STIs (105). Because STI diagnoses \\noften can serve as risk markers for HIV acquisition (83), public \\nhealth services might include follow-up of MSM with an STI \\nto offer HIV PrEP . Public health services can also include HIV \\nand STI prevention interventions including HIV and STI \\ntesting, linkage and relinkage of persons with HIV infection \\nto HIV care clinics, and referral of partners of persons with \\nSTIs or HIV infection to HIV PrEP , as indicated (106–109). \\nClinicians should familiarize themselves with public health \\npractices in their area; however, in most instances, providers \\nshould understand that responsibility for discussing the \\ntreatment of partners of persons with STIs rests with the \\ndiagnosing provider and the patient. State laws require a good \\nfaith effort by the provider to inform partners, and providers \\nshould familiarize themselves with public health laws.\\nClinicians who do not notify partners of patients directly \\ncan still provide partner services by counseling infected persons \\nand providing them with written information and medication \\nto give to their partners (if recommended and allowable by \\nstate law), directly evaluating and treating sex partners, and \\ncooperating with state and local health departments. Clinicians’ \\nefforts to ensure treatment of patients’ sex partners can reduce \\nthe risk for reinfection and potentially diminish transmission \\nof STIs (110). Therefore, clinicians should encourage all \\npersons with STIs to notify their sex partners and urge them \\nto seek medical evaluation and treatment. Exceptions to this \\npractice include circumstances posing a risk for intimate \\npartner violence (111). Available data are limited regarding \\nthe rate of intimate partner violence directly attributable \\nto partner notification (112,113); however, because of the \\nreported prevalence of intimate partner violence in the general \\npopulation (114), providers should consider the potential \\nrisk before notifying partners of persons or encouraging \\npartner notification. Time spent counseling patients about the \\nimportance of notifying partners is associated with improved \\nnotification outcomes (115). When possible, clinicians should \\nadvise persons to bring their primary sex partner with them \\nwhen returning for treatment and should concurrently treat \\nboth persons. Although this approach can be effective for a \\nmain partner (116,117), it might not be a feasible approach \\nfor additional sex partners. Evidence indicates that providing \\npatients with written information to share with sex partners \\ncan increase rates of partner treatment (110).\\nCertain health departments now use technology (e.g., \\nemail, texting, mobile applications, and social media outlets) \\nto facilitate partner services for locating and notifying the \\nsex partners of persons with STIs, including HIV (118,119). \\nPatients now have the option to use Internet sites to send \\nanonymous email or text messages advising partners of their \\nexposure to an STI (120); anonymous notification via the'),\n",

Unless prohibited by law or other \\nregulations, medical providers should routinely offer EPT \\nto patients with chlamydia when the provider cannot ensure \\nthat all of a patient’s sex partners from the previous 60 days \\nwill seek timely treatment. If the patient has not had sex \\nduring the 60 days before diagnosis, providers should offer \\nEPT for the patient’s most recent sex partner. Because EPT \\nmust be an oral regimen and current gonorrhea treatment \\ninvolves an injection, EPT for gonorrhea should be offered \\nto partners unlikely to access timely evaluation after linkage \\nis explored. EPT is legal in the majority of states but varies \\nby chlamydial or gonococcal infection. Providers should visit \\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/ept to obtain updated information for \\ntheir state. Providing patients with packaged oral medication \\nis the preferred approach because the efficacy of EPT using \\nprescriptions has not been evaluated, obstacles to EPT can exist \\nat the pharmacy level (121,122), and many persons (especially \\nadolescents) do not fill the prescriptions provided to them by \\na sex partner (123,124). Medication or prescriptions provided \\nfor EPT should be accompanied by educational materials for \\nthe partner, including treatment instructions, warnings about \\ntaking medications (e.g., if the partner is pregnant or has an \\nallergy to the medication), general health counseling, and a \\nstatement advising that partners seek medical evaluation as \\nsoon as possible for HIV infection and any symptoms of STIs, \\nparticularly PID.\\nEvidence supporting EPT is based on three U.S. clinical \\ntrials involving heterosexual men and women with chlamydia \\nor gonorrhea (125–127). All three trials reported that more \\npartners were treated when patients were offered EPT . T wo \\nreported statistically significant decreases in the rate of \\nreinfection, and one observed a lower risk for persistent or \\nrecurrent infection that was statistically nonsignificant. A \\nfourth trial in the United Kingdom did not demonstrate a \\ndifference in the risk for reinfection or in the numbers of \\npartners treated between persons offered EPT and those \\nadvised to notify their sex partners (128). U.S. trials and a \\nmeta-analysis of EPT revealed that the magnitude of reduction \\nin reinfection of index patients, compared with patient referral, \\ndiffered according to the STI and the sex of the index patient \\n(110,125–127). However, across trials, reductions in chlamydia \\nprevalence at follow-up were approximately 20%, and \\nreductions in gonorrhea were approximately 50% at follow-up.\\nExisting data indicate that EPT also might have a role in \\npartner management for trichomoniasis; however, no partner \\nmanagement intervention has been reported to be more \\neffective than any other in reducing trichomoniasis reinfection \\nrates (129,130). No data support use of EPT in the routine \\nmanagement of patients with syphilis.\\nData are limited regarding use of EPT for gonococcal \\nor chlamydial infections among MSM, compared with \\nheterosexuals (131,132). Published studies, including recent \\ndata regarding extragenital testing, indicated that male partners \\nof MSM with diagnosed gonorrhea or chlamydia might have \\nother bacterial STIs (gonorrhea or syphilis) or HIV (133–135). \\nStudies have reported that 5% of MSM have a new diagnosis \\nof HIV when evaluated as partners of men with gonococcal \\nor chlamydial infections (133,134); however, more recent data \\nindicate that, in certain settings, the frequency of HIV infection \\nis much lower (135). Considering limited data and potential \\nfor other bacterial STIs among MSM partners, shared clinical \\ndecision-making regarding EPT is recommended. All persons \\nwho receive bacterial STI diagnoses and their sex partners, \\nparticularly MSM, should be tested for HIV , and those at risk \\nfor HIV infection should be offered HIV PrEP (https://www.\\ncdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2017.pdf).\\nReporting and Confidentiality\\nAccurate and timely reporting of STIs is integral to public \\nhealth efforts in assessing morbidity trends, allocating limited \\nresources, and assisting local health authorities with partner \\nnotification and treatment. STI and HIV/AIDS cases should \\nbe reported in accordance with state and local statutory \\nrequirements. Syphilis (including congenital syphilis), \\ngonorrhea, chlamydia, chancroid, and HIV are reportable \\ndiseases in every state. Because the requirements for reporting \\nother STIs differ by state, clinicians should be familiar with the \\nreporting requirements applicable within their jurisdictions.\\nReporting can be provider based, laboratory based, or \\nboth.

Additional \\ninformation regarding retesting is available elsewhere in this \\nreport (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections; \\nSyphilis; T richomoniasis).\\nSTI Detection Among Special \\nPopulations\\nPregnant Women\\nIntrauterine or perinatally transmitted STIs can have \\ndebilitating effects on pregnant women, their fetuses, and their \\npartners. All pregnant women and their sex partners should be \\nasked about STIs, counseled about the possibility of perinatal \\ninfections, and provided access to recommended screening and \\ntreatment, if needed.\\nRecommendations for screening pregnant women for \\nSTIs to detect asymptomatic infections are based on disease \\nseverity and sequelae, prevalence among the population, costs, \\nmedicolegal considerations (e.g., state laws), and other factors. \\nThe following screening recommendations for pregnant \\nwomen summarize clinical guidelines from federal agencies \\nand medical professional organizations.\\nScreening Recommendations\\nHIV Infection\\n All pregnant women in the United States should be tested \\nfor HIV at the first prenatal visit, even if they have been \\npreviously tested (138). T esting pregnant women for HIV \\nand prompt linkage to care of women with HIV infection are \\nvital for women’s health and reducing perinatal transmission of \\nHIV through ART and obstetrical interventions. HIV testing \\nshould be offered as part of the routine panel of prenatal tests \\n(i.e., opt-out testing). For women who decline HIV testing, \\nproviders should address their concerns and, when appropriate, \\ncontinue to encourage testing. Partners of pregnant patients \\nshould be offered HIV testing if their status is unknown (139).\\nRetesting in the third trimester (preferably before 36 weeks’ \\ngestation) is recommended for women at high risk for \\nacquiring HIV infection. Examples of women at high risk \\ninclude those who inject drugs, have STIs during pregnancy, \\nhave multiple sex partners during pregnancy, have a new \\nsex partner during pregnancy, or have partners with HIV \\ninfection; those who are receiving care in health care facilities \\nin settings with HIV incidence ≥1 per 1,000 women per year; \\nthose who are incarcerated; those who live in areas with high \\nrates of HIV infection; or those who have signs or symptoms \\nof acute HIV infection (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy, skin \\nrash, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, oral ulcers, leukopenia, \\nthrombocytopenia, or transaminase elevation) (140).\\nRapid HIV testing should be performed for any woman in labor \\nwho has not been tested for HIV during pregnancy or whose HIV \\nstatus is unknown, unless she declines. If a rapid HIV test result \\nis positive, ART should be administered without waiting for the \\nresults of confirmatory testing (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/\\ndefault/files/inline-files/PerinatalGL.pdf).\\nSyphilis\\nDuring 2012–2019, congenital syphilis rates in the United \\nStates increased from 8.4 to 48.5 cases per 100,000 births, \\na 477.4% increase (141). At least 45 states have a prenatal \\nsyphilis testing requirement, with high variability among those \\nrequirements (142). In the United States, all pregnant women \\nshould be screened for syphilis at the first prenatal visit, even \\nif they have been tested previously (143). Prenatal screening \\nfor syphilis has been reported to be suboptimal in the United \\nStates (144,145). T esting in the third trimester and at delivery \\ncan prevent congenital syphilis cases (146,147). Partners of \\npregnant women with syphilis should be evaluated, tested, \\nand treated.\\nWhen access to prenatal care is not optimal, a stat rapid \\nplasma reagin (RPR) card test and treatment, if that test is \\nreactive, should be administered at the time that a pregnancy \\nis confirmed or when the pregnancy test is performed, if \\nfollow-up is uncertain. Pregnant women should be retested \\nfor syphilis at 28 weeks’ gestation and at delivery if the mother \\nlives in a community with high syphilis rates or is at risk for \\nsyphilis acquisition during pregnancy (e.g., misuses drugs or \\nhas an STI during pregnancy, having multiple sex partners, \\nhaving a new sex partner, or having a sex partner with an STI). \\nNeonates should not be discharged from the hospital unless'),\n",

T o avoid misinterpreting a transient positive \\nHBsAg result during the 21 days after vaccination, HBsAg \\ntesting should be performed before vaccine administration. \\nAll laboratories that conduct HBsAg tests should test initially \\nreactive specimens with a licensed neutralizing confirmatory \\ntest.

Pregnant women who remain at increased \\nrisk for chlamydial infection also should be retested during the \\nthird trimester to prevent maternal postnatal complications and \\nchlamydial infection in the neonate. Pregnant women identified \\nas having chlamydia should be treated immediately and have a \\ntest of cure to document chlamydial eradication by a nucleic acid \\namplification test (NAAT) 4 weeks after treatment. All persons \\ndiagnosed with a chlamydial infection should be rescreened \\n3 months after treatment.\\nGonorrhea\\nAll pregnant women aged <25 years as well as women aged \\n≥25 years at increased risk for gonorrhea (e.g., those with other \\nSTIs during pregnancy or those with a new sex partner, more \\nthan one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, \\nor a sex partner who has an STI or is exchanging sex for money \\nor drugs) should be screened for Neisseria gonorrhoeae at the \\nfirst prenatal visit (149). Pregnant women who remain at high \\nrisk for gonococcal infection also should be retested during the \\nthird trimester to prevent maternal postnatal complications and \\ngonococcal infection in the neonate. Clinicians should consider \\nthe communities they serve and might choose to consult local \\npublic health authorities for guidance on identifying groups \\nthat are more vulnerable to gonorrhea acquisition on the basis \\nof local disease prevalence. Gonococcal infection, in particular, \\nis concentrated among specific geographic locations and \\ncommunities (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/default.\\nhtm).

All persons diagnosed with gonorrhea \\nshould be rescreened 3 months after treatment.\\nHepatitis C Virus\\nThe rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has increased \\namong pregnant women in recent years ( 150–153). HCV \\nscreening should be performed for all pregnant women \\nduring each pregnancy, except in settings where the HCV \\ninfection (HCV positivity) rate is <0.1% (154–156). The most \\nimportant risk factor for HCV infection is past or current \\ninjecting drug use (157). Additional risk factors include having \\nhad a blood transfusion or organ transplantation before July \\n1992, having received clotting factor concentrates produced \\nbefore 1987, having received an unregulated tattoo, having \\nbeen on long-term hemodialysis, having other percutaneous \\nexposures, or having HIV infection. All women with HCV \\ninfection should receive counseling, supportive care, and \\nlinkage to care (https://www.hcvguidelines.org).

No state requires \\nparental consent for STI care, although the age at which a \\nminor can provide consent for specified health care services \\n(i.e., HPV vaccination and HIV testing and treatment) varies \\namong states.

Rectal chlamydial testing can be considered \\nfor females on the basis of reported sexual behaviors and \\nexposure, through shared clinical decision-making between the \\npatient and the provider (170,171). Evidence is insufficient \\nto recommend routine screening for C. trachomatis among \\nsexually active young males, on the basis of efficacy and cost-\\neffectiveness. However, screening of sexually active young males \\nshould be considered in clinical settings serving populations \\nof young men with a high prevalence of chlamydial infections \\n(e.g., adolescent service clinics, correctional facilities, and STD \\nclinics). Chlamydia screening, including pharyngeal or rectal \\ntesting, should be offered to all YMSM at least annually on \\nthe basis of sexual behavior and anatomic site of exposure (see \\nMen Who Have Sex with Men).\\nGonorrhea\\nRoutine screening for N. gonorrhoeae on an annual basis is \\nrecommended for all sexually active females aged <25 years \\n(149). Extragenital gonorrhea screening (pharyngeal or rectal) \\ncan be considered for females on the basis of reported sexual \\nbehaviors and exposure, through shared clinical-decision \\nbetween the patient and the provider (170,171). Gonococcal \\ninfection is more prevalent among certain geographic \\nlocations and communities (141). Clinicians should consider \\nthe communities they serve and consult local public health \\nauthorities for guidance regarding identifying groups that are \\nmore vulnerable to gonorrhea acquisition on the basis of local \\ndisease prevalence. Evidence is insufficient to recommend \\nroutine screening, on the basis of efficacy and cost-effectiveness, \\nfor N. gonorrhoeae among asymptomatic sexually active young \\nmales who have sex with females only. Screening for gonorrhea, \\nincluding pharyngeal or rectal testing, should be offered to \\nYMSM at least annually (see Men Who Have Sex with Men).\\nProviders might consider opt-out chlamydia and gonorrhea \\nscreening (i.e., the patient is notified that testing will be \\nperformed unless the patient declines, regardless of reported \\nsexual activity) for adolescent and young adult females during \\nclinical encounters. Cost-effectiveness analyses indicate that \\nopt-out chlamydia screening among adolescent and young \\nadult females might substantially increase screening, be cost-\\nsaving (172), and identify infections among patients who do \\nnot disclose sexual behavior (173).\\nHIV Infection\\nHIV screening should be discussed and offered to all \\nadolescents. Frequency of repeat screenings should be based on \\nthe patient’s sexual behaviors and the local disease prevalence \\n(138). Persons with HIV infection should receive prevention \\ncounseling and linkage to care before leaving the testing site.\\nCervical Cancer\\nGuidelines from USPSTF and ACOG recommend that \\ncervical cancer screening begin at age 21 years (174,175). This \\nrecommendation is based on the low incidence of cervical \\ncancer and limited usefulness of screening for cervical cancer \\namong adolescents (176). In contrast, the 2020 ACS guidelines \\nrecommend that cervical cancer screening begin at age 25 years \\nwith HPV testing. This change is recommended because the \\nincidence of invasive cervical cancer in women aged <25 years \\nis decreasing because of vaccination (177). Adolescents \\nwith HIV infection who have initiated sexual intercourse \\nshould have cervical screening cytology in accordance with \\nHIV/AIDS guidelines (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/\\nguidelines/adult-and-adolescent-opportunistic-infection/\\nhuman-papillomavirus-disease?view=full).\\nOther Sexually Transmitted Infections\\nYMSM and pregnant females should be routinely screened \\nfor syphilis (see Pregnant Women; Men Who Have Sex with \\nMen). Local disease prevalence can help guide decision-\\nmaking regarding screening for T . vaginalis, especially among \\nadolescent females in certain areas. Routine screening of \\nadolescents and young adults who are asymptomatic for certain \\nSTIs (e.g., syphilis, trichomoniasis, BV , HSV , HAV , and HBV) \\nis not typically recommended.'),\n",

The following recommendations \\nfor primary prevention of STIs (i.e., vaccination and \\ncounseling) are based on published clinical guidelines for \\nsexually active adolescents and young adults from federal \\nagencies and medical professional organizations.\\n• HPV vaccination is recommended through age 26 years \\nfor those not vaccinated previously at the routine age of \\n11 or 12 years (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-\\nrecs/vacc-specific/hpv.html).\\n• The HBV vaccination series is recommended for all adolescents \\nand young adults who have not previously received the universal \\nHBV vaccine series during childhood (12).\\n• The HAV vaccination series should be offered to \\nadolescents and young adults as well as those who have \\nnot previously received the universal HAV vaccine series \\nduring childhood (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/\\nschedules/hcp/imz/child-indications.html#note-hepa).\\n• Information regarding HIV transmission, prevention, testing, \\nand implications of infection should be regarded as an essential \\ncomponent of the anticipatory guidance provided to all \\nadolescents and young adults as part of routine health care.\\n• CDC and USPSTF recommend offering HIV PrEP to \\nadolescents weighing ≥35 kg and adults who are HIV \\nnegative and at substantial risk for HIV infection (80,178). \\nYMSM should be offered PrEP in youth-friendly settings \\nwith tailored adherence support (e.g., text messaging and \\nvisits per existing guidelines). Indications for PrEP , initial \\nand follow-up prescribing guidance, and laboratory testing \\nrecommendations are the same for adolescents and adults \\n(https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep).\\n• Medical providers who care for adolescents and young \\nadults should integrate sexuality education into clinical \\npractice. Health care providers should counsel adolescents \\nabout the sexual behaviors that are associated with risk for \\nacquiring STIs and should educate patients regarding \\nevidence-based prevention strategies, which includes a \\ndiscussion about abstinence and other risk-reduction \\nbehaviors (e.g., consistent and correct condom use and \\nreduction in the number of sex partners including \\nconcurrent partners). Interactive counseling approaches \\n(e.g., patient-centered counseling and motivational \\ninterviewing) are effective STI and HIV prevention \\nstrategies and are recommended by USPSTF . Educational \\nmaterials (e.g., handouts, pamphlets, and videos) can \\nreinforce office-based educational efforts.\\nChildren\\nManagement of children who have STIs requires close \\ncooperation among clinicians, laboratorians, and child-\\nprotection authorities. Official investigations, when indicated, \\nshould be initiated promptly. Certain diseases (e.g., gonorrhea, \\nsyphilis, HIV , chlamydia, and trichomoniasis), if acquired after \\nthe neonatal period, strongly indicate sexual contact. For other \\ndiseases (e.g., HSV , HPV and anogenital warts, and vaginitis), \\nthe association with sexual contact is not as clear (see Sexual \\nAssault and Abuse and STIs).\\nMen Who Have Sex with Men\\nMSM comprise a diverse group in terms of behaviors, \\nidentities, and health care needs (179). The term “MSM” often \\nis used clinically to refer to sexual behavior alone, regardless of \\nsexual orientation (e.g., a person might identify as heterosexual \\nbut still be classified as MSM). Sexual orientation is \\nindependent of gender identity. Classification of MSM can vary \\nin the inclusion of transgender men and women on the basis \\nof whether men are defined by sex at birth (i.e., transgender \\nwomen included) or current gender identity (i.e., transgender \\nmen included). Therefore, sexual orientation as well as gender \\nidentity of individual persons and their sex partners should be \\nobtained during health care visits. MSM might be at increased \\nrisk for HIV and other STIs because of their sexual network or \\nbehavioral or biologic factors, including number of concurrent \\npartners, condomless sex, anal sex, or substance use (180–182). \\nThese factors, along with sexual network or higher community \\ndisease prevalence, can increase the risk for STIs among MSM \\ncompared with other groups (183,184).\\nPerforming a detailed and comprehensive sexual history is \\nthe first step in identifying vulnerability and providing tailored \\ncounseling and care (3). Factors associated with increased \\nvulnerability to STI acquisition among MSM include having \\nmultiple partners, anonymous partners, and concurrent \\npartners (185,186). Repeat syphilis infections are common and \\nmight be associated with HIV infection, substance use (e.g., \\nmethamphetamines), Black race, and multiple sex partners \\n(187). Similarly, gonorrhea incidence has increased among MSM \\nand might be more likely to display antimicrobial resistance \\ncompared with other groups (188,189). Gonococcal infection \\namong MSM has been associated with similar risk factors to \\nsyphilis, including having multiple anonymous partners and \\nsubstance use, especially methamphetamines (190). Disparities \\nin gonococcal infection are also more pronounced among certain \\nracial and ethnic groups of MSM (141).'),\n",

In \\nthe United States, the estimated lifetime risk for HIV infection \\namong MSM is one in six, compared with heterosexual men at \\none in 524 and heterosexual women at one in 253 (191). These \\ndisparities are further exacerbated by race and ethnicity, with \\nAfrican American/Black and Hispanic/Latino MSM having a \\none in two and a one in four lifetime risk for HIV infection, \\nrespectively. For HIV , transmission occurs much more readily \\nthrough receptive anal sex, compared with penile-vaginal sex \\n(192). Similar to other STIs, multiple partners, anonymous \\npartners, condomless sex, and substance use are all associated \\nwith HIV infection (193–196). Importantly, other STIs \\nalso might significantly increase the risk for HIV infection \\n(197–199). An estimated 10% of new HIV infections were \\nattributable to chlamydial or gonococcal infection (81). A \\nsubstantial number of MSM remain unaware of their HIV \\ndiagnosis (200). Clinical care involving MSM, including \\nthose who have HIV infection, should involve asking about \\nSTI-related risk factors and routine STI testing. Clinicians \\nshould routinely ask MSM about their sexual behaviors and \\nsymptoms consistent with common STIs, including urethral \\ndischarge, dysuria, ulcers, rash, lymphadenopathy, and \\nanorectal symptoms that might be consistent with proctitis \\n(e.g., discharge, rectal bleeding, pain on defecation, or pain \\nduring anal sex). However, certain STIs are asymptomatic, \\nespecially at rectal and pharyngeal sites, and routine testing \\nis recommended. In addition, clinicians should provide \\neducation and counseling regarding evidence-based safer-sex \\napproaches that have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing \\nSTI incidence (see HIV Infection, Detection, Counseling, \\nand Referral).\\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention\\nPrEP is the use of medications for preventing an infection \\nbefore exposure. Studies have demonstrated that a daily oral \\nmedication TDF/FTC is effective in preventing HIV acquisition, \\nand specifically among MSM (74,75,201). PrEP guidelines \\nprovide information regarding sexually active persons who are at \\nsubstantial risk for acquiring HIV infection (having had anal or \\nvaginal sex during the previous 6 months with either a partner \\nwith HIV infection, a bacterial STI in the past 6 months, or \\ninconsistent or no condom use with a sex partner) or persons \\nwho inject drugs (injecting partner with HIV infection or sharing \\ninjection equipment) (80). Those guidelines provide information \\nregarding daily PrEP use for either TDF/FTC (men or women) \\nor tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine for MSM. Screening \\nfor bacterial STIs should occur at least every 6 months for all \\nsexually active patients and every 3 months among MSM or \\namong patients with ongoing risk behaviors. MSM taking PrEP \\nmight compensate for decreased HIV acquisition risk by using \\ncondoms less frequently or modifying their behavior in other ways \\n(202,203), although data regarding this behavior are inconsistent. \\nStudies have reported that MSM taking PrEP have high rates of \\nSTIs, and frequent screening is warranted (204–206).\\nImportance of Rectal and Pharyngeal Testing\\nRectal and pharyngeal testing by NAAT for gonorrhea \\nand chlamydia is recognized as an important sexual health \\nconsideration for MSM. Rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia are \\nassociated with HIV infection (82,207), and men with repeat \\nrectal infections can be at substantially higher risk for HIV \\nacquisition (208). Pharyngeal infections with gonorrhea or \\nchlamydia might be a principal source of urethral infections \\n(209–211). Studies have demonstrated that among MSM, \\nprevalence of rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia ranges from \\n0.2% to 24% and 2.1% to 23%, respectively, and prevalence \\nof pharyngeal gonorrhea and chlamydia ranges from 0.5% to \\n16.5% and 0% to 3.6%, respectively (171). Approximately \\n70% of gonococcal and chlamydial infections might be \\nmissed if urogenital-only testing is performed among MSM \\n(212–216) because most pharyngeal and rectal infections are \\nasymptomatic. Self-collected swabs have been reported to be \\nan acceptable means of collection for pharyngeal and rectal \\nspecimens (217–219), which can enhance patient comfort \\nand reduce clinical workloads.\\nA detailed sexual history should be taken for all MSM to \\nidentify anatomic locations exposed to infection for screening. \\nClinics that provide services for MSM at high risk should \\nconsider implementing routine extragenital screening for \\nN. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis infections, and screening is \\nlikely to be cost-effective (220).\\nScreening Recommendations\\nSTI screening among MSM has been reported to be \\nsuboptimal. In a cross-sectional sample of MSM in the United \\nStates, approximately one third reported not having had an \\nSTI test during the previous 3 years, and MSM with multiple \\nsex partners reported less frequent screening (221). MSM \\nliving with HIV infection and engaged in care also experience \\nsuboptimal rates of STI testing (222,223). Limited data exist \\nregarding the optimal frequency of screening for gonorrhea, \\nchlamydia, and syphilis among MSM, with the majority of \\nevidence derived from mathematical modeling. Models from \\nAustralia have demonstrated that increasing syphilis screening \\nfrequency from two times a year to four times a year resulted \\nin a relative decrease of 84% from peak prevalence (224). In \\na compartmental model applied to different populations in \\nCanada, quarterly syphilis screening averted more than twice'),\n",

Furthermore, MSM screening coverage \\nneeded for eliminating syphilis among a population is \\nsubstantially reduced from 62% with annual screening to 23% \\nwith quarterly screening (226,227). In an MSM transmission \\nmodel that explored the impact of HIV PrEP use on STI \\nprevalence, quarterly chlamydia and gonorrhea screening was \\nassociated with an 83% reduction in incidence (205). The only \\nempiric data available that examined the impact of screening \\nfrequency come from an observational cohort of MSM using \\nHIV PrEP in which quarterly screening identified more \\nbacterial STIs, and semiannual screening would have resulted \\nin delayed treatment of 35% of total identified STI infections \\n(206). In addition, quarterly screening was reported to have \\nprevented STI exposure in a median of three sex partners \\nper STI infection (206). On the basis of available evidence, \\nquarterly screening for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis for \\ncertain sexually active MSM can improve case finding, which \\ncan reduce the duration of infection at the population level, \\nreduce ongoing transmission and, ultimately, prevalence among \\nthis population (228).\\nPreventive screening for common STIs is indicated for all \\nMSM.

T esting can be offered to MSM \\nwho do not report exposure at these sites after a detailed \\nexplanation, due to known underreporting of risk behaviors. \\nAll MSM with HIV infection entering care should be screened \\nfor gonorrhea and chlamydia at appropriate anatomic sites of \\nexposure as well as for syphilis.\\nMore frequent STI screening (i.e., for syphilis, gonorrhea, \\nand chlamydia) at 3- to 6-month intervals is indicated for \\nMSM, including those taking PrEP and those with HIV \\ninfection, if risk behaviors persist or if they or their sex partners \\nhave multiple partners. In addition, providers can consider \\nthe benefits of offering more frequent HIV screening (e.g., \\nevery 3–6 months) to MSM at increased risk for acquiring \\nHIV infection.\\nHepatitis B Virus\\nAll MSM should be screened with HBsAg, HBV core \\nantibody, and HBV surface antibody testing to detect HBV \\ninfection ( 233). Vaccination against both HAV and HBV \\nis recommended for all MSM for whom previous infection \\nor vaccination cannot be documented. Serologic testing can \\nbe considered before vaccinating if the patient’s vaccination \\nhistory is unknown; however, vaccination should not be \\ndelayed. Vaccinating persons who have had previous infection \\nor vaccination does not increase the risk for vaccine-related \\nadverse events (see Hepatitis A Virus; Hepatitis B Virus).\\nHepatitis C Virus\\nCDC recommends HCV screening at least once for all \\nadults aged ≥18 years, except in settings where the prevalence \\nof HCV infection (HCV RNA positivity) is <0.1% ( 156). \\nThe American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/\\nInfectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend \\nall MSM with HIV infection be screened for HCV during the'),\n",

Sexual \\ntransmission of HCV can occur and is most common among \\nMSM with HIV infection (234–237). Screening for HCV in \\nthis setting is cost-effective ( 238,239). Screening should be \\nperformed by using HCV antibody assays followed by HCV \\nRNA testing for those with a positive antibody test. Suspicion \\nfor acute HCV infection (e.g., clinical evidence of hepatitis and \\nrisk behaviors) should prompt consideration for HCV RNA \\ntesting, despite a negative antibody test.\\nHuman Papillomavirus\\nHPV infection and associated conditions (e.g., anogenital \\nwarts and anal squamous intraepithelial lesions) are highly \\nprevalent among MSM. The HPV vaccination is recommended \\nfor all men, including MSM and transgender persons or \\nimmunocompromised males, including those with HIV \\ninfection, through age 26 years (11). More information is \\navailable at https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/downloads/9vhpv-\\nguidance.pdf.\\nA digital anorectal examination (DARE) should be \\nperformed to detect early anal cancer among persons with HIV \\nand MSM without HIV but who have a history of receptive \\nanal intercourse. Data are insufficient to recommend routine \\nanal cancer screening with anal cytology in populations at risk \\nfor anal cancer (see Anal Cancer). Health centers that initiate a \\ncytology-based screening program should only do so if referrals \\nto high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) and biopsy are available.\\nHerpes Simplex Virus-2\\nEvaluation for HSV-2 infection with type-specific serologic \\ntests also can be considered if infection status is unknown \\namong persons with previously undiagnosed genital tract \\ninfection (see Genital Herpes).\\nPostexposure Prophylaxis and Pre-Exposure \\nProphylaxis for STI Prevention\\nStudies have reported that a benefit might be derived \\nfrom STI PEP and PrEP for STI prevention. One study \\ndemonstrated that monthly oral administration of a 1-g dose \\nof azithromycin reduced infection with N. gonorrhoeae and \\nC. trachomatis  but did not decrease the incidence of HIV \\ntransmission (240). Among MSM, doxycycline taken as PEP in \\na single oral dose ≤24 hours after sex decreased infection with \\nTreponema pallidum and C. trachomatis; however, no substantial \\neffect was observed for infection with N. gonorrhoeae (93). \\nDoxycycline taken as STI PrEP as 100 mg orally once daily \\nalso demonstrated a substantial reduction in gonorrhea, \\nchlamydia, and syphilis among MSM (90). However, these \\nstudies had limitations because of small sample size, short \\nduration of therapy, and concerns about antibiotic resistance, \\nspecifically regarding N. gonorrhoeae (241). Further study is \\nneeded to determine the effectiveness of using antimicrobials \\nfor STI PrEP or PEP .\\nCounseling and Education Approaches\\nDifferent counseling and STI prevention strategies are \\nneeded to effectively engage different groups of MSM. \\nOutreach efforts should be guided by local surveillance efforts \\nand community input. Engaging MSM at risk through social \\nmedia, specifically online hookup sites, is an important \\noutreach effort to consider. Hookup sites are Internet sites \\nand mobile telephone applications that men might use for \\nmeeting other men for sex. Internet use might facilitate sexual \\nencounters and STI transmission among MSM, and many \\nmen report using hookup sites to meet partners (242–245). \\nThe ease and accessibility of meeting partners online might \\nreduce stigma and barriers of meeting partners through \\nother settings. Moreover, these sites offer an opportunity for \\neffective STI prevention messaging (246), although the cost \\nmight be limiting (247). Different groups of MSM might use \\ndifferent hookup sites, and efforts should be guided by local \\ncommunity input. Studies have demonstrated the acceptability \\nand feasibility of reaching MSM through these hookup sites \\nto promote STI prevention efforts (248,249).\\nEnteric Infections Among Men Who Have Sex \\nwith Men\\nThe importance of sexual transmission of enteric pathogens \\namong MSM has been recognized since the 1970s, after the \\nfirst report of MSM-associated shigellosis was reported in \\nSan Francisco (250,251). Global increases in the incidence \\nof shigellosis among adult MSM have been more recently \\nobserved (252–256). Sporadic outbreaks of Shigella sonnei  \\nand Shigella flexneri  have been reported among MSM \\n(257–262). T ransmission occurs through oral-anal contact \\nor sexual contact, and transmission efficiency is enhanced by \\nboth biologic or host and behavioral factors. HIV without \\nviral suppression can be an independent risk factor that \\ncan contribute to transmission by increasing shedding of \\nthe enteric pathogen, increasing susceptibility of the host, \\nor both (255,263). Surveillance data in England during \\n2004–2015 demonstrated that 21% of nontravel-associated \\nShigella diagnoses among MSM were among persons with \\nHIV infection (255).\\nOther enteric organisms might also cause disease among \\nMSM through sexual activities leading to oral-anal contact, \\nincluding bacteria such as Escherichia coli  ( 264) and'),\n",

Behavioral characteristics \\nassociated with the sexual transmission of enteric infections \\nare broadly similar to those associated with other STIs (e.g., \\ngonorrhea, syphilis, and lymphogranuloma venereum [LGV]). \\nThis includes multiple sex partners and online hookup sites \\nthat increase opportunities for sexual mixing, which might \\ncreate dense sexual networks that facilitate STI transmission \\namong MSM (270). Specific behaviors associated with sexually \\ntransmitted enteric infections among MSM involve attendance \\nat sex parties and recreational drug use including chem sex \\n(i.e., using crystal methamphetamine, gamma-butyrolactone, \\nor mephedrone before or during sex), which might facilitate \\ncondomless sex, group sex, fisting, use of sex toys, and scat play \\n(253,271). The growing number of sexually transmitted enteric \\ninfections might be attributable in part to the emergence of \\nantimicrobial resistance. This is well reported regarding Shigella \\nspecies, for which rapid intercontinental dissemination of a \\nS. flexneri 3a lineage with high-level resistance to azithromycin \\nthrough sexual transmission among MSM (272) and clusters \\nof multidrug resistant shigella cases among MSM have recently \\nbeen reported (273). Multidrug-resistant Campylobacter species \\nhave also been documented (266,274). For MSM patients with \\ndiarrhea, clinicians should request laboratory examinations, \\nincluding stool culture; provide counseling about the risk for \\ninfection with enteric pathogens during sexual activity (oral-\\nanal, oral-genital, anal-genital, and digital-anal contact) that \\ncould expose them to enteric pathogens; and choose treatment, \\nwhen needed, according to antimicrobial drug susceptibility.\\nWomen Who Have Sex with Women and \\nWomen Who Have Sex with \\nWomen and Men\\nWSW and WSWM comprise diverse groups with variations \\nin sexual identity, practices, and risk behaviors. Studies \\nindicate that certain WSW , particularly adolescents, young \\nwomen, and WSWM, might be at increased risk for STIs \\nand HIV on the basis of reported risk behaviors (275–280). \\nStudies have highlighted the diversity of sexual practices and \\nexamined use of protective or risk-reduction strategies among \\nWSW populations (281–283). Use of barrier protection with \\nfemale partners (e.g., gloves during digital-genital sex, external \\ncondoms with sex toys, and latex or plastic barriers [also known \\nas dental dams for oral-genital sex]) was infrequent in all \\nstudies. Although health organizations have online materials \\ndirected to patients, few comprehensive and reliable resources \\nof sexual health information for WSW are available (284).\\nRecent studies regarding STI rates among WSW and \\nWSWM indicate that WSWM experience higher rates of STIs \\nthan WSW , with rates comparable with women who have sex \\nwith men (WSM) in all studies reviewed (279,285,286). These \\nstudies indicate that WSW might experience STIs at lower \\nrates than WSWM and WSM, although still at significant \\nrates (287). One study reported higher sexual-risk behaviors \\namong adolescent WSWM and WSW than among adolescent \\nWSM (280). WSW report reduced knowledge of STI risks \\n(288), and both WSW and WSWM experience barriers to care, \\nespecially Black WSW and WSWM (289,290). In addition, a \\ncontinuum of sexual behaviors reported by WSW and WSWM \\nindicates the need for providers to not assume lower risk for \\nWSW , highlighting the importance of an open discussion \\nabout sexual health.\\nFew data are available regarding the risk for STIs conferred \\nby sex between women; however, transmission risk probably \\nvaries by the specific STI and sexual practice (e.g., oral-genital \\nsex; vaginal or anal sex using hands, fingers, or penetrative \\nsex items; and oral-anal sex) (291,292). Practices involving \\ndigital-vaginal or digital-anal contact, particularly with shared \\npenetrative sex items, present a possible means for transmission \\nof infected cervicovaginal or anal secretions. This possibility \\nis most directly supported by reports of shared trichomonas \\ninfections (293,294) and by concordant drug-resistance \\ngenotype testing and phylogenetic linkage analysis identifying \\nHIV transmitted sexually between women (295,296). The \\nmajority of WSW (53%–97%) have had sex with men in the \\npast and continue to do so, with 5%–28% of WSW reporting \\nmale partners during the previous year (292,297–300).\\nHPV can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, \\nand sexual transmission of HPV likely occurs between WSW \\n(301–303). HPV DNA has been detected through polymerase \\nchain reaction (PCR)–based methods from the cervix, vagina, \\nand vulva among 13%–30% of WSW (301,302) and can \\npersist on fomites, including sex toys ( 304). Among WSW \\nwho report no lifetime history of sex with men, 26% had \\nantibodies to HPV-16, and 42% had antibodies to HPV-6 \\n(301). High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and \\nlow-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) have been \\ndetected on Papanicolaou smears (Pap tests) among WSW \\nwho reported no previous sex with men (301,302). WSWM \\nare at risk for acquiring HPV from both their female partners \\nand male partners and thus are at risk for cervical cancer. \\nTherefore, routine cervical cancer screening should be offered \\nto all women, regardless of sexual orientation or practices, \\nand young adult WSW and WSWM should be offered HPV \\nvaccination in accordance with recommendations (11) (https://\\nwww.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html).'),\n",

A U.S. population-based survey \\namong women aged 18–59 years demonstrated an HSV-2 \\nseroprevalence of 30% among women reporting same-sex \\npartners during the previous year, 36% among women \\nreporting same-sex partners in their lifetime, and 24% among \\nwomen reporting no lifetime same-sex behavior (299). HSV-2 \\nseroprevalence among women self-identifying as homosexual \\nor lesbian was 8%, similar to a previous clinic-based study of \\nWSW (299,305) but was 26% among Black WSW in one \\nstudy (287). The relatively frequent practice of orogenital sex \\namong WSW and WSWM might place them at higher risk \\nfor genital infection with HSV-1, a hypothesis supported by \\nthe recognized association between HSV-1 seropositivity and \\nprevious number of female partners. Thus, sexual transmission \\nof HSV-1 and HSV-2 can occur between female sex partners. \\nThis information should be communicated to women as part \\nof sexual health counseling.\\nT richomonas is a relatively common infection among WSW \\nand WSWM, with prevalence rates higher than for chlamydia \\nor gonorrhea (306,307), and direct transmission of trichomonas \\nbetween female partners has been demonstrated (293,294).\\nLimited information is available regarding transmission \\nof bacterial STIs between female partners. T ransmission of \\nsyphilis between female sex partners, probably through oral \\nsex, has been reported. Although the rate of transmission of \\nC. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae between women is unknown, \\ninfection also might be acquired from past or current male \\npartners. Data indicate that C. trachomatis infection among \\nWSW can occur (275, 286, 308, 309). Data are limited \\nregarding gonorrhea rates among WSW and WSWM (170). \\nReports of same-sex behavior among women should not deter \\nproviders from offering and providing screening for STIs, \\nincluding chlamydia, according to guidelines.\\nBV is common among women, and even more so among \\nwomen with female partners (310–312). Epidemiologic data \\nstrongly demonstrate that BV is sexually transmitted among \\nwomen with female partners. Evidence continues to support \\nthe association of such sexual behaviors as having a new partner, \\nhaving a partner with BV , having receptive oral sex, and having \\ndigital-vaginal and digital-anal sex with incident BV (313,314). \\nA study including monogamous couples demonstrated \\nthat female sex partners frequently share identical genital \\nLactobacillus strains (315). Within a community-based \\ncohort of WSW , extravaginal (i.e., oral and rectal) reservoirs \\nof BV-associated bacteria were a risk factor for incident BV \\n(316). Studies have examined the impact of specific sexual \\npractices on the vaginal microflora (306,317–319) and on \\nrecurrent (320) or incident (321,322) BV among WSW . A \\nBV pathogenesis study in WSW reported that Prevotella bivia, \\nGardnerella vaginalis , and Atopobium vaginae  might have \\nsubstantial roles in development of incident BV (323). These \\nstudies have continued to support, although have not proven, \\nthe hypothesis that sexual behaviors, specific BV-associated \\nbacteria, and possibly exchange of vaginal or extravaginal \\nmicrobiota (e.g., oral bacterial communities) between partners \\nmight be involved in the pathogenesis of BV among WSW .\\nAlthough BV is common among WSW , routine screening \\nfor asymptomatic BV is not recommended. Results of one \\nrandomized trial used a behavioral intervention to reduce \\npersistent BV among WSW through reduced sharing of vaginal \\nfluid on hands or sex toys. Women randomly assigned to the \\nintervention were 50% less likely to report receptive digital-\\nvaginal contact without gloves than control subjects, and they \\nreported sharing sex toys infrequently. However, these women \\nhad no reduction in persistent BV at 1 month posttreatment \\nand no reduction in incident episodes of recurrent BV (324). \\nT rials have not been reported examining the benefits of treating \\nfemale partners of women with BV . Recurrent BV among \\nWSW is associated with having a same-sex partner and a lack of \\ncondom use (325). Increasing awareness of signs and symptoms \\nof BV among women and encouraging healthy sexual practices \\n(e.g., avoiding shared sex toys, cleaning shared sex toys, and \\nusing barriers) might benefit women and their partners.\\nSexually active women are at risk for acquiring bacterial, \\nviral, and protozoal STIs from current and previous partners, \\nboth male and female. WSW should not be presumed to be at \\nlow or no risk for STIs on the basis of their sexual orientation. \\nReport of same-sex behavior among women should not deter \\nproviders from considering and performing screening for STIs \\nand cervical cancer according to guidelines. Effective screening \\nrequires that care providers and their female patients engage in \\na comprehensive and open discussion of sexual and behavioral \\nrisks that extends beyond sexual identity.\\nTransgender and Gender Diverse Persons\\nT ransgender persons often experience high rates of stigma and \\nsocioeconomic and structural barriers to care that negatively \\naffect health care usage and increase susceptibility to HIV and \\nSTIs (326–332).

Prevalence studies of transgender \\npersons among the overall population have been limited and \\noften are based on small convenience samples.\\nGender identity is independent of sexual orientation. Sexual \\norientation identities among transgender persons are diverse. \\nPersons who are transgender or gender diverse might have sex \\nwith cisgender men, cisgender women, or other transgender \\nor gender nonbinary persons.\\nClinical Environment Assessment\\nProviders should create welcoming environments that \\nfacilitate disclosure of gender identity and sexual orientation. \\nClinics should document gender identity and sex assigned \\nat birth for all patients to improve sexual health care for \\ntransgender and gender nonbinary persons. Assessment of \\ngender identity and sex assigned at birth has been validated \\namong diverse populations, has been reported to be acceptable \\n(335,336), and might result in increased patients identifying \\nas transgender (337).\\nLack of medical provider knowledge and other barriers to care \\n(e.g., discrimination in health care settings or denial of services) \\noften result in transgender and gender nonbinary persons \\navoiding or delaying preventive care services (338–340) and \\nincurring missed opportunities for HIV and STI prevention \\nservices. Gender-inclusive and trauma-guided health care \\nmight increase the number of transgender patients who seek \\nsexual health services, including STI testing (341), because \\ntransgender persons are at high risk for sexual violence (342).\\nPrimary care providers should take a comprehensive sexual \\nhistory, including a discussion of STI screening, HIV PrEP \\nand PEP , behavioral health, and social determinants of sexual \\nhealth. Clinicians can improve the experience of sexual health \\nscreening and counseling for transgender persons by asking for \\ntheir choice of terminology or modifying language (e.g., asking \\npatients their gender pronouns) to be used during clinic visits \\nand history taking and examination (343). Options for fertility \\npreservation, pregnancy potential, and contraception options \\nshould also be discussed, if indicated. For transgender persons \\nwho retain a uterus and ovaries, ovulation might continue in \\nthe presence of testosterone therapy, and pregnancy potential \\nexists (https://transcare.ucsf.edu).\\nTransgender Women\\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of HIV infection \\namong transgender women estimated that HIV prevalence in \\nthe United States is 14% among transgender women, with the \\nhighest prevalence among Black (44%) and Hispanic (26%) \\ntransgender women (344). Data also demonstrate high rates of \\nHIV infection among transgender women worldwide (345). \\nBacterial STI prevalence varies among transgender women and \\nis based largely on convenience samples. Despite limited data, \\ninternational and U.S. studies have indicated elevated incidence \\nand prevalence of gonorrhea and chlamydia among transgender \\nwomen similar to rates among cisgender MSM (346–348). A \\nrecent study using data from the STD Surveillance Network \\nrevealed that the proportions of transgender women with \\nextragenital chlamydial or gonococcal infections were similar \\nto those of cisgender MSM (349).\\nProviders caring for transgender women should have \\nknowledge of their patients’ current anatomy and patterns \\nof sexual behavior before counseling them about STI and \\nHIV prevention. The majority of transgender women have \\nnot undergone genital-affirmation surgery and therefore \\nmight retain a functional penis; in these instances, they \\nmight engage in insertive oral, vaginal, or anal sex as well as \\nreceptive oral or anal sex. In the U.S. T ransgender Survey, 12% \\nof transgender women had undergone vaginoplasty surgery, \\nand approximately 50% more were considering surgical \\nintervention (350). Providers should have knowledge about \\nthe type of tissue used to construct the neovagina, which \\ncan affect future STI and HIV preventive care and screening \\nrecommendations. The majority of vaginoplasty surgeries \\nconducted in the United States use penile and scrotal tissue \\nto create the neovagina (351). Other surgical techniques \\nuse intestinal tissue (e.g., sigmoid colon graft) or split-skin \\ngrafts (352). Although these surgeries involve penectomy and \\norchiectomy, the prostate remains intact. T ransgender women \\nwho have had a vaginoplasty might engage in receptive vaginal, \\noral, or anal sex.\\nNeovaginal STIs have infrequently been reported in \\nthe literature and include HSV and HPV/genital warts in \\npenile-inversion vaginoplasty, C. trachomatis  in procedures \\nthat involved penile skin and grafts with urethra mucosa or \\nabdominal peritoneal lining (353), and N. gonorrhoeae  in \\nboth penile-inversion and colovaginoplasty ( 354–359). If \\nthe vaginoplasty used an intestinal graft, a risk also exists for \\nbowel-related disease (e.g., adenocarcinoma, inflammatory \\nbowel disease, diversion colitis, and polyps) (360–362).\\nTransgender Men\\nThe few studies of HIV prevalence among transgender men \\nindicated that they have a lower prevalence of HIV infection \\nthan transgender women.

Providers should consider the anatomic \\ndiversity among transgender men because a person can undergo \\na metoidioplasty (a procedure to increase the length of the \\nclitoris), with or without urethral lengthening, and might not \\nhave a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and therefore be at risk \\nfor bacterial STIs, HPV , HSV , HIV , and cervical cancer (366). \\nFor transgender men using gender-affirming hormone therapy, \\nthe decrease in estradiol levels caused by exogenous testosterone \\ncan lead to vaginal atrophy (367,368) and is associated with a \\nhigh prevalence of unsatisfactory sample acquisition (369). The \\nimpact of these hormonal changes on mucosal susceptibility \\nto HIV and STIs is unknown.\\nT ransgender men who have not chosen to undergo \\nhysterectomy with removal of the cervix remain at risk for \\ncervical cancer. These persons often avoid cervical cancer \\nscreening because of multiple factors, including discomfort \\nwith medical examinations and fear of discrimination \\n(338,370). Providers should be aware that conducting a \\nspeculum examination can be technically difficult after \\nmetoidioplasty surgery because of narrowing of the introitus. \\nIn these situations, high-risk HPV testing using a swab can \\nbe considered; self-collected swabs for high-risk HPV testing \\nhas been reported to be an acceptable option for transgender \\nmen (371).\\nScreening Recommendations\\nThe following are screening recommendations for \\ntransgender and gender diverse persons:\\n• Because of the diversity of transgender persons regarding \\nsurgical gender-affirming procedures, hormone use, and \\ntheir patterns of sexual behavior, providers should remain \\naware of symptoms consistent with common STIs and \\nscreen for asymptomatic infections on the basis of the \\npatient’s sexual practices and anatomy.\\n• Gender-based screening recommendations should be \\nadapted on the basis of anatomy (e.g., routine screening \\nfor C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae) as recommended \\nfor all sexually active females aged <25 years on an annual \\nbasis and should be extended to transgender men and \\nnonbinary persons with a cervix among this age group.\\n• HIV screening should be discussed and offered to all \\ntransgender persons. Frequency of repeat screenings should \\nbe based on level of risk.\\n• For transgender persons with HIV infection who have sex \\nwith cisgender men and transgender women, STI \\nscreening should be conducted at least annually, including \\nsyphilis serology, HCV testing, and urogenital and \\nextragenital NAAT for gonorrhea and chlamydia.\\n• T ransgender women who have had vaginoplasty surgery \\nshould undergo routine STI screening for all exposed sites \\n(e.g., oral, anal, or vaginal). No data are available regarding \\nthe optimal screening method (urine or vaginal swab) for \\nbacterial STIs of the neovagina. The usual techniques for \\ncreating a neovagina do not result in a cervix; therefore, \\nno rationale exists for cervical cancer screening (368).\\n• If transgender men have undergone metoidioplasty surgery \\nwith urethral lengthening and have not had a vaginectomy, \\nassessment of genital bacterial STIs should include a \\ncervical swab because a urine specimen will be inadequate \\nfor detecting cervical infections.\\n• Cervical cancer screening for transgender men and \\nnonbinary persons with a cervix should follow current \\nscreening guidelines (see Human Papillomavirus Infections).\\nPersons in Correctional Facilities\\nMultiple studies have demonstrated that persons entering \\ncorrectional facilities have a high prevalence of STIs, HIV , and \\nviral hepatitis, especially those aged ≤35 years (141,372,373). \\nRisk behaviors for acquiring STIs (e.g., having condomless \\nsex, having multiple sex partners, substance misuse, and \\nengaging in commercial, survival, or coerced sex) are common \\namong incarcerated populations.

Detection and treatment \\nof early syphilis in correctional facilities might affect rates \\nof transmission among adults and prevention of congenital \\nsyphilis (377).\\nIn jails, approximately half of entrants are released back \\ninto the community within 48 hours. As a result, treatment \\ncompletion rates for those screened for STIs and who receive \\nSTI diagnoses in short-term facilities might not be optimal. \\nHowever, because of the mobility of incarcerated populations \\nin and out of the community, the impact of screening in \\ncorrectional facilities on the prevalence of infections among \\ndetainees and subsequent transmission in the community \\nafter release might be considerable (378). Moreover, treatment \\ncompletion rates of ≥95% in short-term facilities can be \\nachieved by offering screening at or shortly after intake, \\nthus facilitating earlier receipt of test results and, if needed, \\nfollow-up of untreated persons can be conducted through \\npublic health outreach.\\nUniversal, opt-out screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea \\namong females aged ≤35 years entering juvenile and adult \\ncorrectional facilities is recommended (379). Males aged \\n<30 years entering juvenile and adult correctional facilities \\nshould also be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea (380). \\nOpt-out screening has the potential to substantially increase \\nthe number tested and the number of chlamydia and gonorrhea \\ninfections detected (381–385).

Acute infection transitions to a multiyear, chronic \\nillness that progressively depletes CD4+ T lymphocytes crucial \\nfor maintenance of effective immune function. Ultimately, \\npersons with untreated HIV infection experience symptomatic, \\nlife-threatening immunodeficiency (i.e., AIDS).\\nEffective ART that suppresses HIV replication to undetectable \\nlevels reduces morbidity, provides a near-normal lifespan, and \\nprevents sexual transmission of HIV to others (95–97,410–\\n412). Early diagnosis of HIV and rapid linkage to care are \\nessential for achieving these goals. Guidelines from both the \\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the \\nInternational AIDS Society–USA Panel recommend that all \\npersons with HIV infection be offered effective ART as soon \\nas possible, both to reduce morbidity and mortality and to \\nprevent HIV transmission (413).\\nSTD specialty or sexual health clinics are a vital partner in \\nreducing HIV infections in the United States. These clinics \\nprovide safety net services to vulnerable populations in need \\nof HIV prevention services who are not served by the health \\ncare system and HIV partner service organizations. Diagnosis \\nof an STI is a biomarker for HIV acquisition, especially among \\npersons with primary or secondary syphilis or, among MSM, \\nrectal gonorrhea or chlamydia (197). STD clinics perform only \\napproximately 20% of all federally funded HIV tests nationally \\nbut identify approximately 30% of all new infections (414). \\nAmong testing venues, STD clinics are high performing in \\nterms of linkage to HIV care within 90 days of diagnosis; \\nduring 2013–2017, the percentage of persons with a new \\ndiagnosis in an STD clinic and linked to care within 90 days \\nincreased from 55% to >90% (415,415).\\nScreening Recommendations\\nThe following recommendations apply to testing for HIV:\\n• HIV testing is recommended for all persons seeking STI \\nevaluation who are not already known to have HIV infection. \\nT esting should be routine at the time of the STI evaluation, \\nregardless of whether the patient reports any specific behavioral \\nrisks for HIV . T esting for HIV should be performed at the time \\nof STI diagnosis and treatment if not performed at the initial \\nSTI evaluation and screening (82,195,416).\\n• CDC and USPSTF recommend HIV screening at least \\nonce for all persons aged 15–65 years (417).\\n• Persons at higher risk for HIV acquisition, including \\nsexually active gay, bisexual, and other MSM, should be \\nscreened for HIV at least annually. Providers can consider \\nthe benefits of offering more frequent screening (e.g., every \\n3–6 months) among MSM at increased risk for acquiring \\nHIV (418,419).\\n• All pregnant women should be tested for HIV during the \\nfirst prenatal visit. A second test during the third trimester, \\npreferably at <36 weeks’ gestation, should be considered \\nand is recommended for women who are at high risk for \\nacquiring HIV infection, women who receive health care \\nin jurisdictions with high rates of HIV , and women \\nexamined in clinical settings in which HIV incidence  is \\n≥1 per 1,000 women screened per year (138,140). \\n• HIV screening should be voluntary and free from coercion. \\nPatients should not be tested without their knowledge.\\n• Opt-out HIV screening (notifying the patient that an HIV \\ntest will be performed, unless the patient declines) is \\nrecommended in all health care settings. CDC also \\nrecommends that consent for HIV screening be \\nincorporated into the general informed consent for \\nmedical care in the same manner as other screening or \\ndiagnostic tests.\\n• Requirement of specific signed consent for HIV testing is \\nnot recommended. General informed consent for medical \\ncare is considered sufficient to encompass informed \\nconsent for HIV testing.\\n• Providers should use a laboratory-based antigen/antibody \\n(Ag/Ab) combination assay as the first test for HIV , unless \\npersons are unlikely to follow up with a provider to receive \\ntheir HIV test results; in those cases screening with a rapid \\nPOC test can be useful.\\n• Preliminary positive screening tests for HIV should be \\nfollowed by supplemental testing to establish the diagnosis.\\n• Providing prevention counseling as part of HIV screening \\nprograms or in conjunction with HIV diagnostic testing is \\nnot required (6). However, persons might be more likely to \\nthink about HIV and consider their risk-related behavior \\nwhen undergoing an HIV test. HIV testing gives providers \\nan opportunity to conduct STI and HIV prevention \\ncounseling and communicate risk-reduction messages.\\n• Acute HIV infection can occur among persons who report \\nrecent sexual or needle-sharing behavior or who have had \\nan STI diagnosis.\\n• Providers should test for HIV RNA if initial testing according \\nto the HIV testing algorithm recommended by CDC is \\nnegative or indeterminate when concerned about acute HIV \\ninfection (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/50872).'),\n",

All FDA-cleared HIV tests are \\nhighly sensitive and specific. Available serologic tests can \\ndetect all known subtypes of HIV-1. The majority also detect \\nHIV-2 and uncommon variants of HIV-1 (e.g., group O and \\ngroup N).\\nAccording to an algorithm for HIV diagnosis, CDC \\nrecommends that HIV testing begin with a laboratory-\\nbased HIV-1/HIV-2 Ag/Ab combination assay, which, if \\nrepeatedly reactive, is followed by a laboratory-based assay \\nwith a supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation \\nassay (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/50872). This algorithm \\nconfers an additional advantage because it can detect HIV-2 \\nantibodies after the initial immunoassay. Although HIV-2 is \\nuncommon in the United States, accurate identification is \\nvital because monitoring and therapy for HIV-2 differs from \\nthat for HIV-1 (420). RNA testing should be performed \\non all specimens with reactive immunoassay but negative \\nsupplemental antibody test results to determine whether the \\ndiscordance represents acute HIV infection.\\nRapid POC HIV tests can enable clinicians to make a \\npreliminary diagnosis of HIV infection in <20 minutes. The \\nmajority of rapid antibody assays become reactive later in the \\ncourse of HIV infection than conventional laboratory-based \\nassays and thus can produce negative results among persons \\nrecently infected (e.g., acutely infected persons). Furthermore, \\nHIV home-test kits only detect HIV antibodies and therefore \\nwill not detect acute HIV infection. If early or acute infection \\nis suspected and a rapid HIV antibody assay is negative, \\nconfirmatory testing with combined laboratory-based assays or \\nRNA testing should be performed. CDC recommends that all \\npersons with reactive rapid tests be assessed with a laboratory-\\nbased Ag/Ab assay. Additional details about interpretation of \\nresults by using the HIV testing algorithm recommended by \\nCDC are available at https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/48472.\\nAcute HIV Infection\\nProviders serving persons at risk for STIs are in a position \\nto diagnose HIV infection during its acute phase. Diagnosing \\nHIV infection during the acute phase is particularly important \\nbecause persons with acute HIV have highly infectious \\ndisease due to the concentration of virus in plasma and \\ngenital secretions, which is extremely elevated during that \\nstage of infection (421,422) (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/\\nguidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/acute-and-recent-early-\\nhiv-infection?view=full). ART during acute HIV infection \\nis recommended because it substantially reduces infection \\ntransmission to others, improves laboratory markers of \\ndisease, might decrease severity of acute disease, lowers viral \\nsetpoint, reduces the size of the viral reservoir, decreases \\nthe rate of viral mutation by suppressing replication, and \\npreserves immune function (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/\\nguidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/acute-and-recent-early-\\nhiv-infection?view=full). Persons who receive an acute HIV \\ndiagnosis should be referred immediately to an HIV clinical \\ncare provider, provided prevention counseling (e.g., advised to \\nreduce the number of partners and to use condoms correctly \\nand consistently), and screened for STIs. Information should be \\nprovided regarding availability of PEP for sexual and injecting \\ndrug use partners not known to have HIV infection if the \\nmost recent contact was <72 hours preceding HIV diagnosis.\\nWhen providers test by using the CDC algorithm, specimens \\ncollected during acute infection might give indeterminate or \\nnegative results because insufficient anti-HIV antibodies and \\npotentially insufficient antigen are present to be reactive on \\nAg/Ab combination assays and supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 \\nantibody differentiation assays. Whenever acute HIV infection \\nis suspected (e.g., initial testing according to the CDC algorithm \\nis negative or indeterminate after a possible sexual exposure to \\nHIV within the previous few days to weeks, especially if the \\nperson has symptoms or has primary or secondary syphilis, \\ngonorrhea, or chlamydia), additional testing for HIV RNA \\nis recommended. If this additional testing for HIV RNA is \\nalso negative, repeat testing in a few weeks is recommended \\nto rule out very early acute infection when HIV RNA might \\nnot be detectable. A more detailed discussion of testing in \\nthe context of acute HIV infection is available at https://\\nclinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/\\ninitiation-antiretroviral-therapy?view=full.\\nTreatment\\nART should be initiated as soon as possible for all persons with \\nHIV infection regardless of CD4+ T-cell count, both for individual \\nhealth and to prevent HIV transmission (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.\\ngov/sites/default/files/inline-files/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf).'),\n",

Early HIV diagnosis \\nand treatment is thus not only vital for individual health but also as \\na public health intervention to prevent new infections. Knowledge \\nof the prevention benefit of treatment can help reduce stigma and \\nincrease the person’s commitment to start and remain adherent \\nto ART (423). The importance of adherence should be stressed \\nas well as the fact that ART does not protect against other STIs \\nthat can be prevented by using condoms. Interventions to assist \\npersons to remain adherent to their prescribed HIV treatment, to \\notherwise reduce the possibility of transmission to others, and to \\nprotect themselves against STIs, have been developed for diverse \\npopulations at risk (424) (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/\\nfiles/inline-files/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf).\\nComprehensive HIV treatment and care services might not \\nbe available in facilities focused primarily on STI treatment. \\nProviders in such settings should be knowledgeable about HIV \\ntreatment and care options available in their communities \\nand promptly link persons who have newly diagnosed HIV \\ninfection and any persons with HIV infection who are not \\nengaged in ongoing effective care to a health care provider \\nor facility experienced in caring for persons living with HIV \\n(https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/\\nAdultandAdolescentGL.pdf).\\nOther HIV Management Considerations\\nBehavioral and psychosocial services are integral to caring for \\npersons with HIV infection. Providers should expect persons \\nto be distressed when first informed that they have HIV . They \\nface multiple adaptive challenges, including coping with the \\nreactions of others to a stigmatizing illness, developing and \\nadopting strategies to maintain physical and emotional health, \\ninitiating changes in behavior to prevent HIV transmission to \\nothers, and reducing the risk for acquiring additional STIs. \\nMany persons will require assistance gaining access to health \\ncare and other support services and coping with changes in \\npersonal relationships.\\nPersons with HIV infection might have additional needs \\n(e.g., referral for substance use or mental health disorders). \\nOthers require assistance to secure and maintain employment \\nand housing. Persons capable of reproduction might require \\nfamily planning counseling, information about reproductive \\nhealth choices, and referral for reproductive health care.\\nThe following recommendations apply to managing persons \\nwith diagnosed HIV infection:\\n• Link persons with HIV infection to care and start them \\non ART as soon as possible.\\n• Report cases (in accordance with local requirements) to \\npublic health and initiate partner services.\\n• Provide prevention counseling to persons with diagnosed \\nHIV infection.\\n• Ensure all persons with HIV infection are informed that \\nif they achieve and maintain a suppressed viral load, they \\nhave effectively no risk for transmitting HIV . Stress that \\na suppressed viral load is not a substitute for condoms and \\nbehavioral modifications because ART does not protect \\npersons with HIV against other STIs.\\n• Provide additional counseling, either on-site or through \\nreferral, about the psychosocial and medical implications \\nof having HIV infection.\\n• Assess the need for immediate medical care and \\npsychosocial support.\\n• Link persons with diagnosed HIV infection to services \\nprovided by health care personnel experienced in managing \\nHIV infection. Additional services that might be needed \\ninclude substance misuse counseling and treatment, \\ntreatment for mental health disorders or emotional distress, \\nreproductive counseling, risk-reduction counseling, and \\ncase management. Providers should follow up to ensure \\nthat patients have received services for any identified needs.\\n• Persons with HIV infection should be educated about the \\nimportance of ongoing medical care and what to expect \\nfrom these services.\\nSTI Screening of Persons with HIV Infection in HIV \\nCare Settings\\nAt the initial HIV care visit, providers should screen all \\nsexually active persons for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, \\nand perform screening for these infections at least annually \\nduring the course of HIV care (425). Specific testing \\nincludes syphilis serology and NAAT for N. gonorrhoeae and \\nC. trachomatis at the anatomic site of exposure. Women should \\nalso be screened for trichomoniasis at the initial visit and \\nannually thereafter. Women should be screened for cervical \\ncancer precursor lesions per existing guidelines (98).\\nMore frequent screening for syphilis, gonorrhea, and \\nchlamydia (e.g., every 3 or 6 months) should be tailored \\nto individual risk and the local prevalence of specific STIs. \\nCertain STIs can be asymptomatic; their diagnosis might \\nprompt referral for partner services, might identify sexual and \\nneedle-sharing partners who can benefit from early diagnosis \\nand treatment of HIV , and might prompt reengagement in \\ncare or HIV prevention services (e.g., PEP or PrEP) (8).

Early diagnosis and treatment \\nof HIV among all potentially exposed sexual and injecting \\ndrug sharing partners can improve their health and reduce \\nnew infections. For those partners without HIV infection, \\npartner services also provide an opportunity for offering HIV \\nprevention services, including PrEP or PEP (if exposure was \\n<72 hours previous) and STI testing and treatment.\\nHealth care providers should inform persons with diagnosed \\nHIV infection about any legal obligations of providers to report \\ncases of HIV to public health; the local confidential processes \\nfor managing partner services, including that a public health \\ndepartment still might be in contact to follow up in their care \\nand partner services; and the benefits and risks of partner \\nnotification and services. Health care providers should also \\nencourage persons with a new HIV diagnosis to notify their \\npartners and provide them with referral information for their \\npartners about HIV testing. Partner notification for exposure \\nto HIV should be confidential. Health care providers can assist \\nin the partner notification process, either directly or by referral \\nto health department partner notification programs. Health \\ndepartment staff are trained to use public health investigation \\nstrategies for confidentially locating persons who can benefit \\nfrom HIV treatment, care, or prevention services.

Detailed \\nrecommendations for notification, evaluation, and treatment of \\nexposed partners are available in Recommendations for Partner \\nServices Programs for HIV Infection, Syphilis, Gonorrhea, and \\nChlamydial Infections (111).\\nSpecial Considerations\\nPregnancy\\nAll pregnant women should be tested for HIV during the \\nfirst prenatal visit. A second test during the third trimester, \\npreferably at <36 weeks’ gestation, should be considered and \\nis recommended for women who are at high risk for acquiring \\nHIV , women who receive health care in jurisdictions with high \\nrates of HIV infection, and women served in clinical settings \\nin which prenatal screening identifies ≥1 pregnant woman \\nwith HIV per 1,000 women screened (138). Diagnostic \\nalgorithms for HIV for pregnant women do not differ from \\nthose for nonpregnant women (see STI Detection Among \\nSpecial Populations). Pregnant women should be informed \\nthat HIV testing will be performed as part of the routine panel \\nof prenatal tests (138); for women who decline HIV testing, \\nproviders should address concerns that pose obstacles, discuss \\nthe benefits of testing (e.g., early HIV detection, treatment, and \\ncare for improving health of the mother and reducing perinatal \\ntransmission of HIV), and encourage testing at subsequent \\nprenatal visits. Women who decline testing because they have \\nhad a previous negative HIV test result should be informed \\nabout the importance of retesting during each pregnancy. \\nWomen with no prenatal care should be tested for HIV at the \\ntime of delivery.\\nT esting pregnant women is crucial because knowledge of \\ninfection status can help maintain the woman’s health, and \\nit enables receipt of interventions (i.e., ART or specialized \\nobstetrical care) that can substantially reduce the risk for \\nperinatal transmission of HIV . Pregnant women with \\ndiagnosed HIV infection should be educated about the benefits \\nof ART for their own health and for reducing the risk for HIV \\ntransmission to their infant. In the absence of ART , a mother’s \\nrisk for transmitting HIV to her neonate is approximately \\n30%; however, risk can be reduced to <2% through ART , \\nobstetrical interventions (i.e., elective cesarean delivery at \\n38 weeks’ pregnancy), and breastfeeding avoidance (https://\\nclinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/PerinatalGL.\\npdf).

GUDs (e.g., \\nsyphilis, herpes, and LGV) might also present as oral ulcers. \\nGenital herpes, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and chancroid \\nhave been associated with an increased risk for HIV acquisition \\nand transmission. Genital, anal, or perianal lesions can also be \\nassociated with infectious and noninfectious conditions that \\nare not sexually transmitted (e.g., yeast, trauma, carcinoma, \\naphthae or Behcet’s disease, fixed drug eruption, or psoriasis).\\nA diagnosis based only on medical history and physical \\nexamination frequently can be inaccurate. Therefore, all \\npersons who have genital, anal, or perianal ulcers should be \\nevaluated. Specific evaluation of genital, anal, or perianal ulcers \\nincludes syphilis serology tests and darkfield examination \\nfrom lesion exudate or tissue, or NAAT if available; NAAT \\nor culture for genital herpes type 1 or 2; and serologic testing \\nfor type-specific HSV antibody. In settings where chancroid is \\nprevalent, a NAAT or culture for Haemophilus ducreyi should \\nbe performed.\\nNo FDA-cleared NAAT for diagnosing syphilis is available \\nin the United States; however, multiple FDA-cleared NAATs \\nare available for diagnosing HSV-1 and HSV-2 in genital \\nspecimens. Certain clinical laboratories have developed their \\nown syphilis and HSV NAATs and have conducted Clinical \\nLaboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) verification \\nstudies with genital specimens. Type-specific serology for \\nHSV-2 might aid in identifying persons with genital herpes \\n(see Genital Herpes). In addition, biopsy of ulcers with \\nimmunohistochemistry can help identify the cause of ulcers \\nthat are unusual or that do not respond to initial therapy. HIV \\ntesting should be performed on all persons not known to have \\nHIV infection who present with genital, anal, or perianal ulcers \\n(see Diagnostic Considerations in disease-specific sections). \\nNAAT testing at extragenital sites should be considered for \\ncases in which GUDs are suspected (e.g., oral manifestations \\nof syphilis, herpes, or LGV). Commercially available NAATs \\nhave not been cleared by FDA for these indications; however, \\nthey can be used by laboratories that have met regulatory \\nrequirements for an off-label procedure.\\nBecause early syphilis treatment decreases transmission \\npossibility, public health standards require health care \\nproviders to presumptively treat any patient with a suspected \\ncase of infectious syphilis at the initial visit, even before test \\nresults are available. Presumptive treatment of a patient with a \\nsuspected first episode of genital herpes also is recommended \\nbecause HSV treatment benefits depend on prompt therapy \\ninitiation. The clinician should choose the presumptive \\ntreatment on the basis of the clinical presentation (i.e., HSV \\nlesions begin as vesicles and primary syphilis as a papule) and \\nepidemiologic circumstances (e.g., high incidence of disease \\namong populations and communities and travel history). For \\nexample, syphilis is so common among MSM that any male \\nwho has sex with men presenting with a genital ulcer should be \\npresumptively treated for syphilis at the initial visit after syphilis \\nand HSV tests are performed. After a complete diagnostic \\nevaluation, >25% of patients who have genital ulcers might \\nnot have a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (426).\\nChancroid\\nChancroid prevalence has declined in the United States \\n(141). When infection does occur, it is usually associated \\nwith sporadic outbreaks. Worldwide, chancroid appears to \\nhave decreased as well, although infection might still occur in \\ncertain Africa regions and the Caribbean. Chancroid is a risk \\nfactor in HIV transmission and acquisition (197).\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nA definitive diagnosis of chancroid requires identifying \\nH. ducreyi  on special culture media that is not widely \\navailable from commercial sources; even when these media \\nare used, sensitivity is <80% (427). No FDA-cleared NAAT \\nfor H. ducreyi  is available in the United States; however, \\nsuch testing can be performed by clinical laboratories that \\nhave developed their own NAAT and have conducted CLIA \\nverification studies on genital specimens.\\nThe combination of one or more deep and painful \\ngenital ulcers and tender suppurative inguinal adenopathy \\nindicates the chancroid diagnosis; inguinal lymphadenitis \\ntypically occurs in <50% of cases (428). For both clinical and \\nsurveillance purposes, a probable diagnosis of chancroid can \\nbe made if all of the following four criteria are met: 1) the \\npatient has one or more painful genital ulcers; 2) the clinical \\npresentation, appearance of genital ulcers and, if present, \\nregional lymphadenopathy are typical for chancroid; 3) the \\npatient has no evidence of T . pallidum infection by darkfield \\nexamination or NAAT (i.e., ulcer exudate or serous fluid) or \\nby serologic tests for syphilis performed at least 7–14 days \\nafter onset of ulcers; and 4) HSV-1 or HSV-2 NAAT or HSV \\nculture performed on the ulcer exudate or fluid are negative.\\nTreatment\\nSuccessful antimicrobial treatment for chancroid cures \\nthe infection, resolves the clinical symptoms, and prevents \\ntransmission to others.

Patients should be \\ntested for HIV at the time chancroid is diagnosed. If the initial \\nHIV test results were negative, the provider can consider the \\nbenefits of offering more frequent testing and HIV PrEP to \\npersons at increased risk for HIV infection.\\nFollow-Up\\nPatients should be reexamined 3–7 days after therapy \\ninitiation. If treatment is successful, ulcers usually improve \\nsymptomatically within 3 days and objectively within 7 days \\nafter therapy. If no clinical improvement is evident, the clinician \\nshould consider whether the diagnosis is correct, another STI \\nis present, the patient has HIV infection, the treatment was \\nnot used as instructed, or the H. ducreyi strain causing the \\ninfection is resistant to the prescribed antimicrobial. The time \\nrequired for complete healing depends on the size of the ulcer; \\nlarge ulcers might require >2 weeks. In addition, healing can \\nbe slower for uncircumcised men who have ulcers under the \\nforeskin. Clinical resolution of fluctuant lymphadenopathy is \\nslower than that of ulcers and might require needle aspiration \\nor incision and drainage, despite otherwise successful therapy. \\nAlthough needle aspiration of buboes is a simpler procedure, \\nincision and drainage might be preferred because of reduced \\nneed for subsequent drainage procedures.\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nRegardless of whether disease symptoms are present, sex \\npartners of patients with chancroid should be examined and \\ntreated if they had sexual contact with the patient during the \\n10 days preceding the patient’s symptom onset.\\nSpecial Considerations\\nPregnancy\\nData indicate ciprofloxacin presents a low risk to the \\nfetus during pregnancy but has potential for toxicity during \\nbreastfeeding (431). Alternative drugs should be used if the \\npatient is pregnant or lactating. No adverse effects of chancroid \\non pregnancy outcome have been reported.\\nHIV Infection\\nPersons with HIV infection who have chancroid infection \\nshould be monitored closely because they are more likely to \\nexperience chancroid treatment failure and to have ulcers \\nthat heal slowly (430,432). Persons with HIV might require \\nrepeated or longer courses of therapy, and treatment failures \\ncan occur with any regimen. Data are limited concerning \\nthe therapeutic efficacy of the recommended single-dose \\nazithromycin and ceftriaxone regimens among persons with \\nHIV infection.\\nChildren\\nBecause sexual contact is the major primary transmission route \\namong U.S. patients, diagnosis of chancroid ulcers among infants \\nand children, especially in the genital or perineal region, is highly \\nsuspicious of sexual abuse. However, H. ducreyi is recognized as a \\nmajor cause of nonsexually transmitted cutaneous ulcers among \\nchildren in tropical regions and, specifically, countries where \\nyaws is endemic (433–435). Acquisition of a lower-extremity \\nulcer attributable to H. ducreyi in a child without genital ulcers \\nand reported travel to a region where yaws is endemic should \\nnot be considered evidence of sexual abuse.\\nGenital Herpes \\nGenital herpes is a chronic, lifelong viral infection. T wo types \\nof HSV can cause genital herpes: HSV-1 and HSV-2. Most \\ncases of recurrent genital herpes are caused by HSV-2, and \\n11.9% of persons aged 14–49 years are estimated to be infected \\nin the United States (436). However, an increasing proportion \\nof anogenital herpetic infections have been attributed to \\nHSV-1, which is especially prominent among young women \\nand MSM (186,437,438).\\nThe majority of persons infected with HSV-2 have not \\nhad the condition diagnosed, many of whom have mild or \\nunrecognized infections but shed virus intermittently in the \\nanogenital area. Consequently, most genital herpes infections \\nare transmitted by persons unaware that they have the \\ninfection or who are asymptomatic when transmission occurs. \\nManagement of genital HSV should address the chronic nature \\nof the infection rather than focusing solely on treating acute \\nepisodes of genital lesions.'),\n",

If genital lesions are present, \\nclinical diagnosis of genital herpes should be confirmed by type-\\nspecific virologic testing from the lesion by NAAT or culture (186). \\nRecurrences and subclinical shedding are much more frequent for \\nHSV-2 genital herpes infection than for HSV-1 genital herpes \\n(439,440). Therefore, prognosis and counseling depend on which \\nHSV type is present. Type-specific serologic tests can be used to \\naid in the diagnosis of HSV infection in the absence of genital \\nlesions. Both type-specific virologic and type-specific serologic tests \\nfor HSV should be available in clinical settings that provide care \\nto persons with or at risk for STIs. HSV-2 genital herpes infection \\nincreases the risk for acquiring HIV twofold to threefold; therefore, \\nall persons with genital herpes should be tested for HIV (441).\\nVirologic Tests\\nHSV NAAT assays are the most sensitive tests because \\nthey detect HSV from genital ulcers or other mucocutaneous \\nlesions; these tests are increasingly available ( 442–444). \\nAlthough multiple FDA-cleared assays exist for HSV detection, \\nthese tests vary in sensitivity from 90.9% to 100%; however, \\nthey are considered highly specific (445–447). PCR is also \\nthe test of choice for diagnosing HSV infections affecting the \\ncentral nervous system (CNS) and systemic infections (e.g., \\nmeningitis, encephalitis, and neonatal herpes). HSV PCR \\nof the blood should not be performed to diagnose genital \\nherpes infection, except in cases in which concern exists for \\ndisseminated infection (e.g., hepatitis). In certain settings, viral \\nculture is the only available virologic test. The sensitivity of viral \\nculture is low, especially for recurrent lesions, and decreases \\nrapidly as lesions begin to heal (443,448). Viral culture \\nisolates and PCR amplicons should be typed to determine \\nwhether HSV-1 or HSV-2 is causing the infection. Failure to \\ndetect HSV by NAAT or culture, especially in the presence \\nof older lesions or the absence of active lesions, does not \\nindicate an absence of HSV infection because viral shedding \\nis intermittent. Similarly, random or blind genital swabs in \\nthe absence of lesions should not be used to diagnose genital \\nHSV infection because sensitivity is low, and a negative result \\ndoes not exclude the presence of HSV infection.\\nCytologic detection of cellular changes associated with HSV \\ninfection is an insensitive and nonspecific method of diagnosing \\ngenital lesions (i.e., Tzanck preparation) and therefore should \\nnot be relied on. Although a direct immunofluorescence \\nassay using fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies is also \\navailable for detecting HSV antigen from genital specimens, \\nthis assay lacks sensitivity and is not recommended (449).\\nType-Specific Serologic Tests\\nBoth type-specific and type-common antibodies to HSV \\ndevelop during the first weeks after infection and persist \\nindefinitely. The majority of available, accurate type-\\nspecific HSV serologic assays are based on the HSV-specific \\nglycoprotein G2 (gG2) (HSV-2) and glycoprotein G1 (gG1) \\n(HSV-1). Type-common antibody tests do not distinguish \\nbetween HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection; therefore, type-specific \\nserologic assays should be requested (450–452).\\nBoth laboratory-based assays and POC tests that provide \\nresults for HSV-2 antibodies from capillary blood or serum \\nduring a clinic visit are available. The sensitivity of glycoprotein \\nG type-specific tests for detecting HSV-2 antibody varies from \\n80% to 98%; false-negative results might be more frequent \\nat early stages of infection (451,453,454). Therefore, in \\ncases of recent suspected HSV-2 acquisition, repeat type-\\nspecific antibody testing 12 weeks after the presumed time \\nof acquisition is indicated. The most commonly used test, \\nHerpeSelect HSV-2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA), often is \\nfalsely positive at low index values (1.1–3.0) (457–457). One \\nstudy reported an overall specificity of 57.4%, with a specificity \\nof 39.8% for index values of 1.1–2.9 (458). Because of the \\npoor specificity of commercially available type-specific EIAs, \\nparticularly with low index values (<3.0), a confirmatory test \\n(Biokit or Western blot) with a second method should be \\nperformed before test interpretation. Use of confirmatory \\ntesting with the Biokit or the Western blot assays have been \\nreported to improve accuracy of HSV-2 serologic testing (459). \\nThe HerpeSelect HSV-2 immunoblot should not be used for \\nconfirmation because it uses the same antigen as the HSV-2 \\nEIA. If confirmatory tests are unavailable, patients should be \\ncounseled about the limitations of available testing before \\nobtaining serologic tests, and health care providers should be \\naware that false-positive results occur. Immunoglobulin M \\n(IgM) testing for HSV-1 or HSV-2 is not useful because \\nIgM tests are not type specific and might be positive during \\nrecurrent genital or oral episodes of herpes (460). Therefore, \\nHSV IgM testing is not recommended.\\nBecause approximately all HSV-2 infections are sexually \\nacquired, presence of type-specific HSV-2 antibody implies \\nanogenital infection. In this instance, education and counseling \\nfor persons with genital HSV infections should be provided. \\nThe presence of HSV-1 antibody alone is more difficult \\nto interpret.

In addition, HSV-1 serologic testing \\nhas low sensitivity for detection of HSV-1 antibody (458). \\nHowever, acquisition of HSV-1 genital herpes is increasing, \\nand HSV-1 genital herpes also can be asymptomatic (437–\\n439,461,462). Diagnosis of HSV-1 infection is confirmed by \\nvirologic tests from genital lesions.\\nType-specific HSV-2 serologic assays for diagnosing \\nHSV-2 are useful in the following scenarios: recurrent or \\natypical genital symptoms or lesions with a negative HSV \\nPCR or culture result, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes \\nwithout laboratory confirmation, and a patient’s partner has \\ngenital herpes. HSV-2 serologic screening among the general \\npopulation is not recommended. Patients who are at higher \\nrisk for infection (e.g., those presenting for an STI evaluation, \\nespecially for persons with ≥10 lifetime sex partners, and \\npersons with HIV infection) might need to be assessed for a \\nhistory of genital herpes symptoms, followed by type-specific \\nHSV serologic assays to diagnose genital herpes for those with \\ngenital symptoms.\\nGenital Herpes Management\\nAntiviral medication offers clinical benefits to symptomatic \\npatients and is the mainstay of management. The goals for \\nuse of antiviral medications to treat genital herpes infection \\nare to treat or prevent symptomatic genital herpes recurrences \\nand improve quality of life and suppress the virus to prevent \\ntransmission to sexual partners. Counseling regarding the \\nnatural history of genital herpes, risks for sexual and perinatal \\ntransmission, and methods for reducing transmission is also \\nintegral to clinical management.\\nSystemic antiviral drugs can partially control the signs and \\nsymptoms of genital herpes when used to treat first clinical and \\nrecurrent episodes or when used as daily suppressive therapy. \\nHowever, these drugs neither eradicate latent virus nor affect \\nthe risk, frequency, or severity of recurrences after the drug \\nis discontinued. Randomized trials have indicated that three \\nFDA-approved antiviral medications provide clinical benefit \\nfor genital herpes: acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir \\n(463–471). Valacyclovir is the valine ester of acyclovir and has \\nenhanced absorption after oral administration, allowing for \\nless frequent dosing than acyclovir. Famciclovir also has high \\noral bioavailability. T opical therapy with antiviral drugs offers \\nminimal clinical benefit and is discouraged.\\nFirst Clinical Episode of Genital Herpes\\nNewly acquired genital herpes can cause a prolonged \\nclinical illness with severe genital ulcerations and neurologic \\ninvolvement. Even persons with first-episode herpes who have \\nmild clinical manifestations initially can experience severe or \\nprolonged symptoms during recurrent infection. Therefore, \\nall patients with first episodes of genital herpes should receive \\nantiviral therapy.\\nRecommended Regimens for First Clinical Episode of Genital \\nHerpes*\\nAcyclovir† 400 mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days\\nor\\nFamciclovir 250 mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days\\nor\\nValacyclovir 1 g orally 2 times/day for 7–10 days\\n*  Treatment can be extended if healing is incomplete after 10 days of therapy.\\n† Acyclovir 200 mg orally 5 times/day is also effective but is not \\nrecommended because of the frequency of dosing.\\nRecurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes\\nAlmost all persons with symptomatic first-episode HSV-2 \\ngenital herpes subsequently experience recurrent episodes of \\ngenital lesions. Intermittent asymptomatic shedding occurs \\namong persons with HSV-2 genital herpes infection, even \\nthose with longstanding clinically silent infection. Antiviral \\ntherapy for recurrent genital herpes can be administered either \\nas suppressive therapy to reduce the frequency of recurrences \\nor episodically to ameliorate or shorten the duration of lesions. \\nCertain persons, including those with mild or infrequent \\nrecurrent outbreaks, benefit from antiviral therapy; therefore, \\noptions for treatment should be discussed. Many persons prefer \\nsuppressive therapy, which has the additional advantage of \\ndecreasing the risk for transmitting HSV-2 genital herpes to \\nsusceptible partners (472,473).\\nSuppressive Therapy for Recurrent HSV-2 \\nGenital Herpes\\nSuppressive therapy reduces frequency of genital herpes \\nrecurrences by 70%–80% among patients who have frequent \\nrecurrences (469–472). Persons receiving such therapy \\noften report having experienced no symptomatic outbreaks. \\nSuppressive therapy also is effective for patients with less \\nfrequent recurrences. Long-term safety and efficacy have \\nbeen documented among patients receiving daily acyclovir, \\nvalacyclovir, and famciclovir (474). Quality of life is improved \\nfor many patients with frequent recurrences who receive \\nsuppressive therapy rather than episodic treatment (475). \\nProviders should discuss with patients on an annual basis \\nwhether they want to continue suppressive therapy because \\nfrequency of genital HSV-2 recurrence diminishes over time \\nfor many persons. However, neither treatment discontinuation \\nnor laboratory monitoring is necessary because adverse events \\nand development of HSV antiviral resistance related to long-\\nterm antiviral use are uncommon.'),\n",

Impaired renal function warrants an adjustment \\nin acyclovir dosage.\\nHepatitis\\nHepatitis is a rare manifestation of disseminated HSV \\ninfection, often reported among pregnant women who \\nacquire HSV during pregnancy (484). Pregnant women in \\nany trimester can present with fever and hepatitis (markedly \\nelevated transaminases) but might not have any genital or skin \\nlesions. HSV hepatitis is associated with fulminant liver failure \\nand high mortality (25%). Therefore, a high index of suspicion \\nfor HSV is necessary, with a confirmatory diagnosis by HSV \\nPCR from blood (485). Among pregnant women with fever \\nand unexplained severe hepatitis, disseminated HSV infection \\nshould be considered, and empiric IV acyclovir should be \\ninitiated pending confirmation (484).\\nPrevention\\nConsistent and correct condom use has been reported \\nin multiple studies to decrease, but not eliminate, the risk \\nfor HSV-2 transmission from men to women (486–488). \\nCondoms are less effective for preventing transmission from \\nwomen to men (489). T wo randomized clinical trials of \\nmedical male circumcision (MMC) demonstrated a decreased \\nrisk for HSV-2 acquisition among men in Uganda and \\nSouth Africa (66,68). Results from a third trial conducted \\nin Kenya did not demonstrate a substantial difference in \\nHSV-2 acquisition among men who received MMC (490). \\nA systematic review indicated high consistency for decreased \\nrisk for HSV-2 acquisition among women with a male partner \\nwho underwent MMC (491). These data indicate that MMC \\ncan be associated with decreased risk for HSV-2 acquisition \\namong adult heterosexual men and with decreased risk for \\nHSV-2 transmission from male to female partners.\\nRandomized clinical trials have demonstrated that PrEP with \\ndaily oral TDF/FTC decreases the risk for HSV-2 acquisition \\nby 30% in heterosexual partnerships (492). Pericoital \\nintravaginal tenofovir 1% gel also decreases the risk for HSV-2 \\nacquisition among heterosexual women (493). Among MSM \\nand transgender women, daily oral TDF/FTC decreases the \\nrisk for severe ulcers with symptomatic genital HSV-2 infection \\nbut not for HSV-2 acquisition (494). Insufficient evidence \\nexists that TDF/FTC use among those who are not at risk for \\nHIV acquisition will prevent HSV-2 infection, and it should \\nnot be used for that sole purpose. Oral TDF does not prevent \\nHSV-2 acquisition among persons with HIV infection who \\nare taking TDF as part of their ART regimen (495). No data \\nindicate that antivirals (acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir) \\ncan be taken as PrEP by persons without HSV-2 to prevent \\nits acquisition.\\nCounseling\\nCounseling of persons with genital herpes and their sex \\npartners is crucial for management. The goals of counseling \\ninclude helping patients cope with the infection and preventing \\nsexual and perinatal transmission. Although initial counseling \\ncan be provided at the first visit, patients often benefit from \\nlearning about the chronic aspects of the disease after the acute \\nillness subsides. Multiple resources, including Internet sites and \\nprinted materials, are available to assist patients, their partners, \\nand clinicians who provide counseling (496,497) (https://www.\\nashasexualhealth.org and https://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes).\\nAlthough the psychological effect of a serologic diagnosis of \\nHSV-2 infection in a person with asymptomatic or unrecognized \\ngenital herpes appears minimal and transient (498,499), certain \\npersons with HSV infection might express anxiety concerning \\ngenital herpes that does not reflect the actual clinical severity \\nof their disease; the psychological effect of HSV infection can \\nbe substantial. Common concerns about genital herpes include \\nthe severity of initial clinical manifestations, recurrent episodes, \\nsexual relationships and transmission to sex partners, and ability \\nto bear healthy children.\\nSymptomatic HSV-2 Genital Herpes\\nWhen counseling persons with symptomatic HSV-2 genital \\nherpes infection, the provider should discuss the following:\\n• The natural history of the disease, with emphasis on the \\npotential for recurrent episodes, asymptomatic viral \\nshedding, and the attendant risks for sexual transmission \\nof HSV to occur during asymptomatic periods \\n(asymptomatic viral shedding is most frequent during the \\nfirst 12 months after acquiring HSV-2).\\n• The effectiveness of daily suppressive antiviral therapy for \\npreventing symptomatic recurrent episodes of genital \\nherpes for persons experiencing a first episode or recurrent \\ngenital herpes.\\n• The effectiveness of daily use of valacyclovir in reducing \\nrisk for transmission of HSV-2 among persons without \\nHIV (473) and use of episodic therapy to shorten the \\nduration of recurrent episodes.\\n• The importance of informing current sex partners about \\ngenital herpes and informing future partners before \\ninitiating a sexual relationship.\\n• The importance of abstaining from sexual activity with \\nuninfected partners when lesions or prodromal symptoms \\nare present.'),\n",

Mothers of newborns who acquire \\nneonatal herpes often lack histories of clinically evident genital \\nherpes (514,515).

Although granuloma \\ninguinale was previously endemic in Australia, it is now \\nextremely rare (536,537). Clinically, the disease is characterized \\nas painless, slowly progressive ulcerative lesions on the genitals \\nor perineum without regional lymphadenopathy; subcutaneous \\ngranulomas (pseudobuboes) also might occur. The lesions \\nare highly vascular (i.e., beefy red appearance) and can bleed. \\nExtragenital infection can occur with infection extension to \\nthe pelvis, or it can disseminate to intra-abdominal organs, \\nbones, or the mouth. The lesions also can develop secondary \\nbacterial infection and can coexist with other sexually \\ntransmitted pathogens.\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nThe causative organism of granuloma inguinale is difficult \\nto culture, and diagnosis requires visualization of dark-staining \\nDonovan bodies on tissue crush preparation or biopsy. \\nAlthough no FDA-cleared molecular tests for the detection of \\nK. granulomatis DNA exist, molecular assays might be useful \\nfor identifying the causative agent.\\nTreatment\\nMultiple antimicrobial regimens have been effective; \\nhowever, only a limited number of controlled trials have \\nbeen published (538). T reatment has been reported to halt \\nprogression of lesions, and healing typically proceeds inward \\nfrom the ulcer margins. Prolonged therapy is usually required to \\npermit granulation and reepithelialization of the ulcers. Relapse \\ncan occur 6–18 months after apparently effective therapy.'),\n",

For these reasons, pregnant and \\nlactating women with granuloma inguinale should be treated \\nwith a macrolide regimen (erythromycin or azithromycin).\\nHIV Infection\\nPersons with granuloma inguinale and HIV infection should \\nreceive the same regimens as those who do not have HIV .\\nLymphogranuloma Venereum\\nLGV is caused by C. trachomatis serovars L1, L2, or L3 \\n(539,540). LGV can cause severe inflammation and invasive \\ninfection, in contrast with C. trachomatis serovars A–K that \\ncause mild or asymptomatic infection. Clinical manifestations \\nof LGV can include GUD, lymphadenopathy, or proctocolitis. \\nRectal exposure among MSM or women can result in \\nproctocolitis, which is the most common presentation of \\nLGV infection (541), and can mimic inflammatory bowel \\ndisease with clinical findings of mucoid or hemorrhagic \\nrectal discharge, anal pain, constipation, fever, or tenesmus \\n(542,543). Outbreaks of LGV proctocolitis have been \\nreported among MSM with high rates of HIV infection \\n(544–547). LGV proctocolitis can be an invasive, systemic \\ninfection and, if it is not treated early, can lead to chronic \\ncolorectal fistulas and strictures; reactive arthropathy has also \\nbeen reported. However, reports indicate that rectal LGV can \\nalso be asymptomatic (548). A common clinical manifestation \\nof LGV among heterosexuals is tender inguinal or femoral \\nlymphadenopathy that is typically unilateral. A self-limited \\ngenital ulcer or papule sometimes occurs at the site of inoculation. \\nHowever, by the time persons seek care, the lesions have often \\ndisappeared. LGV-associated lymphadenopathy can be severe, \\nwith bubo formation from fluctuant or suppurative inguinal or \\nfemoral lymphadenopathy. Oral ulceration can occur and might \\nbe associated with cervical adenopathy (549–551). Persons with \\ngenital or colorectal LGV lesions can also experience secondary \\nbacterial infection or can be infected with other sexually and \\nnonsexually transmitted pathogens.\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nA definitive LGV diagnosis can be made only with LGV-\\nspecific molecular testing (e.g., PCR-based genotyping). These \\ntests can differentiate LGV from non–LGV C. trachomatis in \\nrectal specimens. However, these tests are not widely available, \\nand results are not typically available in a time frame that \\nwould influence clinical management. Therefore, diagnosis is \\nbased on clinical suspicion, epidemiologic information, and a \\nC. trachomatis NAAT at the symptomatic anatomic site, along \\nwith exclusion of other etiologies for proctocolitis, inguinal \\nlymphadenopathy, or genital, oral, or rectal ulcers (551,552). \\nGenital or oral lesions, rectal specimens, and lymph node \\nspecimens (i.e., lesion swab or bubo aspirate) can be tested \\nfor C. trachomatis by NAAT or culture. NAAT is the preferred \\napproach for testing because it can detect both LGV strains and \\nnon–LGV C. trachomatis strains (553). Therefore, all persons \\npresenting with proctocolitis should be tested for chlamydia \\nwith a NAAT performed on rectal specimens.

Prolonged \\ntherapy might be required because a delay in resolution of \\nsymptoms might occur.\\nSyphilis\\nSyphilis is a systemic disease caused by T . pallidum. The \\ndisease has been divided into stages on the basis of clinical \\nfindings, which guide treatment and follow-up. Persons who \\nhave syphilis might seek treatment for signs or symptoms. \\nPrimary syphilis classically presents as a single painless ulcer \\nor chancre at the site of infection but can also present with \\nmultiple, atypical, or painful lesions (564). Secondary syphilis \\nmanifestations can include skin rash, mucocutaneous lesions, \\nand lymphadenopathy. T ertiary syphilis can present with \\ncardiac involvement, gummatous lesions, tabes dorsalis, and \\ngeneral paresis.\\nLatent infections (i.e., those lacking clinical manifestations) \\nare detected by serologic testing. Latent syphilis acquired \\nwithin the preceding year is referred to as early latent syphilis; \\nall other cases of latent syphilis are classified as late latent \\nsyphilis or latent syphilis of unknown duration.\\nT . pallidum can infect the CNS, which can occur at any stage \\nof syphilis and result in neurosyphilis. Early neurologic clinical \\nmanifestations or syphilitic meningitis (e.g., cranial nerve \\ndysfunction, meningitis, meningovascular syphilis, stroke, \\nand acute altered mental status) are usually present within \\nthe first few months or years of infection. Late neurologic \\nmanifestations (e.g., tabes dorsalis and general paresis) occur \\n10 to >30 years after infection.\\nInfection of the visual system (ocular syphilis) or auditory \\nsystem (otosyphilis) can occur at any stage of syphilis but is \\ncommonly identified during the early stages and can present \\nwith or without additional CNS involvement. Ocular syphilis \\noften presents as panuveitis but can involve structures in \\nboth the anterior and posterior segment of the eye, including \\nconjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, posterior interstitial keratitis, \\noptic neuropathy, and retinal vasculitis. Ocular syphilis can \\nresult in permanent vision loss. Otosyphilis typically presents \\nwith cochleo-vestibular symptoms, including tinnitus, vertigo, \\nand sensorineural hearing loss. Hearing loss can be unilateral or \\nbilateral, have a sudden onset, and progress rapidly. Otosyphilis \\ncan result in permanent hearing loss.\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nDarkfield examinations and molecular tests for detecting \\nT . pallidum  directly from lesion exudate or tissue are \\nthe definitive methods for diagnosing early syphilis and \\ncongenital syphilis (565). Although no T . pallidum direct-\\ndetection molecular NAATs are commercially available, \\ncertain laboratories provide locally developed and validated \\nPCR tests for detecting T . pallidum DNA. A presumptive \\ndiagnosis of syphilis requires use of two laboratory serologic \\ntests: a nontreponemal test (i.e., Venereal Disease Research \\nLaboratory [VDRL] or rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test) \\nand a treponemal test (i.e., the T . pallidum passive particle \\nagglutination [TP-PA] assay, various EIAs, chemiluminescence \\nimmunoassays [CIAs] and immunoblots, or rapid treponemal \\nassays) (566–568). At least 18 treponemal-specific tests are \\ncleared for use in the United States. Use of only one type of \\nserologic test (nontreponemal or treponemal) is insufficient \\nfor diagnosis and can result in false-negative results among \\npersons tested during primary syphilis and false-positive results \\namong persons without syphilis or previously treated syphilis.\\nNontreponemal Tests and Traditional Algorithm\\nFalse-positive nontreponemal test results can be associated \\nwith multiple medical conditions and factors unrelated to \\nsyphilis, including other infections (e.g., HIV), autoimmune \\nconditions, vaccinations, injecting drug use, pregnancy, \\nand older age (566,569). Therefore, persons with a reactive \\nnontreponemal test should always receive a treponemal test \\nto confirm the syphilis diagnosis (i.e., traditional algorithm). \\nNontreponemal test antibody titers might correlate with disease \\nactivity and are used for monitoring treatment response. Serum \\nshould be diluted to identify the highest titer, and results should \\nbe reported quantitatively. A fourfold change in titer, equivalent \\nto a change of two dilutions (e.g., from 1:16 to 1:4 or from 1:8 \\nto 1:32), is considered necessary for demonstrating a clinically \\nsignificant difference between two nontreponemal test results \\nobtained by using the same serologic test, preferably from the \\nsame manufacturer to avoid variation in results. Sequential \\nserologic tests for a patient should be performed using the \\nsame testing method (VDRL or RPR), preferably by the same \\nlaboratory. VDRL and RPR are equally valid assays; however, \\nquantitative results from the two tests cannot be compared \\ndirectly with each other because the methods are different, \\nand RPR titers frequently are slightly higher than VDRL titers.\\nNontreponemal test titers usually decrease after treatment \\nand might become nonreactive with time. However, for certain \\npersons, nontreponemal antibodies might decrease less than \\nfourfold after treatment (i.e., inadequate serologic response) \\nor might decline appropriately but fail to serorevert and'),\n",

Atypical nontreponemal serologic \\ntest results (e.g., unusually high, unusually low, or fluctuating \\ntiters) might occur regardless of HIV status. When serologic \\ntests do not correspond with clinical findings indicative of \\nprimary, secondary, or latent syphilis, presumptive treatment is \\nrecommended for persons with risk factors for syphilis, and use \\nof other tests (e.g., biopsy for histology and immunostaining \\nand PCR of lesion) should be considered. For the majority \\nof persons with HIV infection, serologic tests are accurate \\nand reliable for diagnosing syphilis and evaluating response \\nto treatment.\\nTreponemal Tests and Reverse \\nSequence Algorithm\\nThe majority of patients who have reactive treponemal tests \\nwill have reactive tests for the remainder of their lives, regardless \\nof adequate treatment or disease activity. However, 15%–25% \\nof patients treated during the primary stage revert to being \\nserologically nonreactive after 2–3 years (570). T reponemal \\nantibody titers do not predict treatment response and therefore \\nshould not be used for this purpose.\\nClinical laboratories sometimes screen syphilis serologic \\nsamples by using automated treponemal immunoassays, \\ntypically by EIA or CIA (571–573). This reverse sequence \\nalgorithm for syphilis testing can identify persons previously \\ntreated for syphilis, those with untreated or incompletely \\ntreated syphilis, and those with false-positive results that can \\noccur with a low likelihood of infection (574). Persons with \\na positive treponemal screening test should have a standard \\nquantitative nontreponemal test with titer performed \\nreflexively by the laboratory to guide patient management \\ndecisions. If the nontreponemal test is negative, the laboratory \\nshould perform a treponemal test different from the one used \\nfor initial testing, preferably TP-PA or treponemal assay based \\non different antigens than the original test, to adjudicate the \\nresults of the initial test.\\nIf a second treponemal test is positive (e.g., EIA reactive, \\nRPR nonreactive, or TP-PA reactive), persons with a history \\nof previous treatment will require no further management \\nunless sexual history indicates a reexposure. In this instance, a \\nrepeat nontreponemal test 2–4 weeks after a confirmed medical \\nhistory and physical examination is recommended to evaluate \\nfor early infection. Those without a history of treatment for \\nsyphilis should be offered treatment. Unless a medical history \\nor results of a physical examination indicate a recent infection, \\npreviously untreated persons should be treated for syphilis of \\nunknown duration or late latent syphilis.\\nIf the second treponemal test is negative (e.g., EIA reactive, \\nRPR nonreactive, TP-PA nonreactive) and the epidemiologic \\nrisk and clinical probability for syphilis are low, further \\nevaluation or treatment is not indicated.\\nMultiple studies demonstrate that high quantitative index \\nvalues or high signal-to-cutoff ratio from treponemal EIA \\nor CIA tests correlate with TP-PA positivity, which might \\neliminate the need for additional confirmatory testing; \\nhowever, the range of index values varies among different \\ntreponemal immunoassays, and the values that correspond to \\nhigh levels of reactivity with confirmatory testing might differ \\nby immunoassay (567,575–582).\\nCerebrospinal Fluid Evaluation\\nFurther testing with CSF evaluation is warranted for \\npersons with clinical signs of neurosyphilis (e.g., cranial nerve \\ndysfunction, meningitis, stroke, acute or chronic altered mental \\nstatus, or loss of vibration sense). All patients with ocular \\nsymptoms and reactive syphilis serology need a full ocular \\nexamination, including cranial nerve evaluation. If cranial nerve \\ndysfunction is present, a CSF evaluation is needed. Among \\npersons with isolated ocular symptoms (i.e., no cranial nerve \\ndysfunction or other neurologic abnormalities), confirmed \\nocular abnormalities on examination, and reactive syphilis \\nserology, a CSF examination is unnecessary before treatment. \\nCSF analysis can be helpful in evaluating persons with ocular \\nsymptoms and reactive syphilis serology who do not have ocular \\nfindings or cranial nerve dysfunction on examination. Among \\npatients with isolated auditory abnormalities and reactive \\nsyphilis serology, CSF evaluation is likely to be normal and is \\nunnecessary before treatment (583,584).\\nLaboratory testing is helpful in supporting the diagnosis of \\nneurosyphilis; however, no single test can be used to diagnose \\nneurosyphilis in all instances. Diagnosis of neurosyphilis \\ndepends on a combination of CSF tests (e.g., CSF cell count, \\nprotein, or reactive CSF-VDRL) in the presence of reactive \\nserologic test (nontreponemal and treponemal) results and \\nneurologic signs and symptoms. CSF laboratory abnormalities \\nare common for persons with early syphilis and are of \\nunknown medical significance in the absence of neurologic \\nsigns or symptoms (585). CSF-VDRL is highly specific but \\ninsensitive. For a person with neurologic signs or symptoms, a \\nreactive CSF-VDRL (in the absence of blood contamination) \\nis considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis.\\nWhen CSF-VDRL is negative despite clinical signs of \\nneurosyphilis, reactive serologic tests results, lymphocytic \\npleocytosis, or protein, neurosyphilis should be considered. \\nIn that instance, additional evaluation by using fluorescent \\ntreponemal-antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) or TP-PA testing \\non CSF might be warranted. The CSF FTA-ABS test is less \\nspecific for neurosyphilis than the CSF-VDRL but is highly \\nsensitive. Fewer data are available regarding CSF TP-PA;'),\n",

Neurosyphilis is highly unlikely with \\na negative CSF FTA-ABS or TP-PA test, especially among \\npersons with nonspecific neurologic signs and symptoms (587).\\nAmong persons with HIV infection, CSF leukocyte count \\ncan be elevated (>5 WBCs/mm 3); the association with CSF \\nleukocyte count and plasma HIV viral suppression has not been \\nwell characterized. Using a higher cutoff (>20 WBCs/mm3) \\nmight improve the specificity of neurosyphilis diagnosis among \\nthis population (588).\\nTreatment\\nPenicillin G, administered parenterally, is the preferred drug \\nfor treating patients in all stages of syphilis. The preparation \\nused (i.e., benzathine, aqueous procaine, or aqueous \\ncrystalline), dosage, and length of treatment depend on the \\nstage and clinical manifestations of the disease. T reatment for \\nlate latent syphilis (>1 years’ duration) and tertiary syphilis \\nrequires a longer duration of therapy because organisms \\ntheoretically might be dividing more slowly (the validity of this \\nrationale has not been assessed). Longer treatment duration is \\nrequired for persons with latent syphilis of unknown duration \\nto ensure that those who did not acquire syphilis within the \\npreceding year are adequately treated.\\nSelection of the appropriate penicillin preparation is \\nimportant because T . pallidum can reside in sequestered sites \\n(e.g., the CNS and aqueous humor) that are poorly accessed \\nby certain forms of penicillin. Combinations of benzathine \\npenicillin, procaine penicillin, and oral penicillin preparations \\nare not considered appropriate for syphilis treatment. Reports \\nhave indicated that practitioners have inadvertently prescribed \\ncombination long- and short-acting benzathine-procaine \\npenicillin (Bicillin C-R) instead of the standard benzathine \\npenicillin product (Bicillin L-A) recommended in the United \\nStates for treating primary, secondary, and latent syphilis. \\nPractitioners, pharmacists, and purchasing agents should be \\naware of the similar names of these two products to avoid \\nusing the incorrect combination therapy agent for treating \\nsyphilis (589).\\nPenicillin’s effectiveness for treating syphilis was well \\nestablished through clinical experience even before the value of \\nrandomized controlled clinical trials was recognized. Therefore, \\napproximately all recommendations for treating syphilis are \\nbased not only on clinical trials and observational studies, but \\non many decades of clinical experience.\\nSpecial Considerations\\nPregnancy\\nParenteral penicillin G is the only therapy with documented \\nefficacy for syphilis during pregnancy. Pregnant women with \\nsyphilis at any stage who report penicillin allergy should be \\ndesensitized and treated with penicillin (see Management of \\nPersons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy).\\nJarisch-Herxheimer Reaction\\nThe Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is an acute febrile reaction \\nfrequently accompanied by headache, myalgia, and fever that \\ncan occur within the first 24 hours after the initiation of any \\nsyphilis therapy; it is a reaction to treatment and not an allergic \\nreaction to penicillin. Patients should be informed about this \\npossible adverse reaction and how to manage it if it occurs. The \\nJarisch-Herxheimer reaction occurs most frequently among \\npersons who have early syphilis, presumably because bacterial \\nloads are higher during these stages. Antipyretics can be used \\nto manage symptoms; however, they have not been proven to \\nprevent this reaction. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction might \\ninduce early labor or cause fetal distress in pregnant women; \\nhowever, this should not prevent or delay therapy (590) (see \\nSyphilis During Pregnancy).\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nSexual transmission of T . pallidum is thought to occur only \\nwhen mucocutaneous syphilitic lesions are present. Such \\nmanifestations are uncommon after the first year of infection. \\nPersons exposed through sexual contact with a person who \\nhas primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis should be \\nevaluated clinically and serologically and treated according to \\nthe following recommendations:\\n• Persons who have had sexual contact with a person who \\nreceives a diagnosis of primary, secondary, or early latent \\nsyphilis <90 days before the diagnosis should be treated \\npresumptively for early syphilis, even if serologic test results \\nare negative.\\n• Persons who have had sexual contact with a person who \\nreceives a diagnosis of primary, secondary, or early latent \\nsyphilis >90 days before the diagnosis should be treated \\npresumptively for early syphilis if serologic test results are \\nnot immediately available and the opportunity for \\nfollow-up is uncertain. If serologic tests are negative, no \\ntreatment is needed. If serologic tests are positive, \\ntreatment should be based on clinical and serologic \\nevaluation and syphilis stage.\\n• In certain areas or among populations with high syphilis \\ninfection rates, health departments recommend notification \\nand presumptive treatment of sex partners of persons with'),\n",

Infants and children aged \\n≥1 month with primary and secondary syphilis should be \\nmanaged by a pediatric infectious disease specialist and \\nevaluated for sexual abuse (e.g., through consultation with child \\nprotective services) (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children).\\nOther Management Considerations\\nAll persons who have primary and secondary syphilis should \\nbe tested for HIV at the time of diagnosis and treatment. Those \\npersons whose HIV test results are negative should be offered \\nHIV PrEP . In geographic areas in which HIV prevalence is \\nhigh, persons who have primary or secondary syphilis should \\nbe offered PrEP and retested for HIV in 3 months if the initial \\nHIV test result was negative.\\nPersons who have syphilis and symptoms or signs indicating \\nneurologic disease (e.g., cranial nerve dysfunction, meningitis, \\nstroke, or altered mental state) should have an evaluation \\nthat includes CSF analysis. Persons with syphilis who have \\nsymptoms or signs of ocular syphilis (e.g., uveitis, iritis, \\nneuroretinitis, or optic neuritis) should have a thorough cranial \\nnerve examination and ocular slit-lamp and ophthalmologic \\nexaminations. CSF evaluation is not always needed for persons \\nwith ocular syphilis if no evidence of cranial nerves 2, 3, 4, \\n5, and 6 dysfunction or other evidence of neurologic disease \\nexists. If symptoms and signs of otic syphilis are present then \\nan otologic examination is needed; CSF evaluation in persons \\nwith otic syphilis does not aid in the clinical management \\nand therefore is not recommended (see Cerebrospinal Fluid \\nEvaluation). T reatment should be guided by the results of these \\nevaluations. Invasion of CSF by T . pallidum accompanied \\nby CSF laboratory abnormalities is common among adults \\nwho have primary or secondary syphilis but has unknown \\nmedical significance (585). In the absence of clinical \\nneurologic findings, no evidence supports variation from the \\nrecommended treatment regimen for primary or secondary \\nsyphilis. Symptomatic neurosyphilis after treatment with the \\npenicillin regimens recommended for primary and secondary \\nsyphilis is rare. Therefore, unless clinical signs or symptoms of \\nneurologic or ophthalmic involvement are present, routine CSF \\nanalysis is not recommended for persons who have primary or \\nsecondary syphilis.\\nFollow-Up\\nClinical and serologic evaluation should be performed at \\n6 and 12 months after treatment; more frequent evaluation \\nmight be prudent if opportunity for follow-up is uncertain \\nor if repeat infection is a clinical concern. Serologic response \\n(i.e., titer) should be compared with the titer at the time of \\ntreatment. However, assessing serologic response to treatment \\ncan be difficult, and definitive criteria for cure or failure by \\nserologic criteria have not been well established. In addition, \\nnontreponemal test titers might decrease more slowly for \\npersons previously treated for syphilis (594,595).\\nPersons who have signs or symptoms that persist or recur \\nand those with at least a fourfold increase in nontreponemal'),\n",

Persons who have latent syphilis and who \\nacquired syphilis during the preceding year are classified as \\nhaving early latent syphilis (early nonprimary, nonsecondary). \\nPersons can receive a diagnosis of early latent syphilis if, during \\nthe year preceding the diagnosis, they had a documented \\nseroconversion or a sustained (>2 weeks) fourfold or greater \\nincrease in nontreponemal test titers in a previously treated \\nperson; unequivocal symptoms of primary or secondary \\nsyphilis; or a sex partner documented to have primary, \\nsecondary, or early latent syphilis. In addition, for persons \\nwith reactive nontreponemal and treponemal tests whose only \\npossible exposure occurred during the previous 12 months, \\nearly latent syphilis can be assumed.\\nIn the absence of these conditions associated with latent \\nsyphilis, an asymptomatic person should be considered to \\nhave latent syphilis of unknown duration or late latent syphilis \\n(>1 year’s duration). Nontreponemal serologic titers usually are \\nhigher early in the course of syphilis infection. However, early \\nlatent syphilis cannot be reliably diagnosed solely on the basis \\nof nontreponemal titers. All persons with latent syphilis should \\nhave careful examination of all accessible mucosal surfaces to \\nevaluate for mucosal lesions (primary or secondary syphilis) \\nbefore making a latent syphilis diagnosis. Physical examination \\nshould include the oral cavity, perianal area, perineum, rectum, \\nand genitals (vagina and cervix for women; scrotum, penis, and \\nunderneath the foreskin for uncircumcised men).\\nTreatment\\nBecause latent syphilis is not transmitted sexually, the \\nobjective of treating persons in this disease stage is to prevent \\nmedical complications of syphilis. Latent syphilis can also be \\nvertically transmitted to a fetus; therefore, the goal of treating \\na pregnant woman is to prevent congenital syphilis. Although \\nclinical experience supports the effectiveness of penicillin in \\nachieving this goal, limited evidence is available for guiding \\nchoice of specific regimens or duration. Available data \\ndemonstrate that additional doses of benzathine penicillin G, \\namoxicillin, or other antibiotics in early latent syphilis do not \\nenhance efficacy, regardless of HIV status (592,593,609).\\nRecommended Regimens for Latent Syphilis* Among Adults\\nEarly latent syphilis: Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM in a \\nsingle dose\\nLate latent syphilis: Benzathine penicillin G 7.2 million units total, \\nadministered as 3 doses of 2.4 million units IM each at 1-week intervals\\n*  Recommendations for treating syphilis in persons with HIV and pregnant \\nwomen are discussed elsewhere in this report (see Syphilis Among \\nPersons with HIV Infection; Syphilis During Pregnancy).\\nInfants and children aged ≥1 month with diagnosed latent \\nsyphilis should be managed by a pediatric infectious disease \\nspecialist and receive a CSF examination. In addition, birth \\nand maternal medical records should be reviewed to assess \\nwhether these infants and children have congenital or acquired \\nsyphilis. For those with congenital syphilis, treatment should \\nbe undertaken as described (see Congenital Syphilis). Those \\nwith acquired syphilis should be evaluated for sexual abuse \\n(e.g., through consultation with child protection services) (see \\nSexual Assault or Abuse of Children). These regimens are for \\nchildren who are not allergic to penicillin who have acquired \\nsyphilis and who have normal CSF examinations.\\nOther Management Considerations\\nAll persons who have latent syphilis should be tested for HIV \\nat the time of diagnosis or treatment. Those persons whose \\nHIV test results are negative should be offered HIV PrEP . In \\ngeographic areas in which the prevalence of HIV infection is \\nhigh or among populations vulnerable to HIV acquisition, \\npersons who have early latent or late latent syphilis should be \\noffered PrEP and retested for HIV in 3 months if the first HIV \\ntest result was negative.\\nPersons who receive a diagnosis of latent syphilis and have \\nneurologic or ocular signs and symptoms (e.g., cognitive \\ndysfunction, motor or sensory deficits, ophthalmic or auditory \\nsymptoms, cranial nerve palsies, or symptoms or signs of \\nmeningitis or stroke) should be evaluated for neurosyphilis, ocular \\nsyphilis, or otosyphilis according to their clinical presentation \\n(see Neurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, and Otosyphilis).\\nIf a person receives a delayed dose of penicillin in a course of \\nweekly therapy for late latent syphilis or syphilis of unknown \\nduration, the course of action that should be recommended \\nis unclear. Clinical experience indicates that an interval of \\n10–14 days between doses of benzathine penicillin for latent \\nsyphilis might be acceptable before restarting the sequence of \\ninjections (i.e., if dose 1 is administered on day 0, dose 2 is \\nadministered on days 10–14). Pharmacologic considerations \\nindicate that an interval of 7–9 days between doses, if feasible, \\nmight be preferred (610–612). Delayed doses are not optimal \\nfor pregnant women receiving therapy for latent syphilis (613). \\nPregnant women who have delays in any therapy dose >9 days \\nbetween doses should repeat the full course of therapy.\\nFollow-Up\\nQuantitative nontreponemal serologic tests should be \\nrepeated at 6, 12, and 24 months.

Persons with \\nHIV infection and neurosyphilis should be treated according \\nto the recommendations for persons with neurosyphilis and \\nwithout HIV infection (see Neurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, \\nand Otosyphilis).\\nFollow-Up\\nPersons with HIV and neurosyphilis infection should be \\nmanaged according to the recommendations for persons without \\nHIV infection. Serum RPR can be followed for necessary \\ntreatment success rather than following CSF parameters (see \\nNeurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, and Otosyphilis). Limited data \\nindicate that changes in CSF parameters might occur more \\nslowly among persons with HIV infection, especially those \\nwith more advanced immunosuppression (588,624).\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nSee Syphilis, Management of Sex Partners.\\nSpecial Considerations\\nPenicillin Allergy\\nPersons with HIV who are allergic to penicillin and have \\nneurosyphilis infection should be managed according to the \\nrecommendations for persons without HIV infection with \\nneurosyphilis who are allergic to penicillin (see Neurosyphilis, \\nOcular Syphilis, and Otosyphilis). Small observational studies \\nconducted among persons with HIV and neurosyphilis report \\nthat ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV daily for 10–14 days might be \\neffective as an alternative agent (628–630). The possibility \\nof cross-sensitivity between ceftriaxone and penicillin exists; \\nhowever, the risk for penicillin cross-reactivity between \\nthird-generation cephalosporins is negligible (619–621,631) \\n(see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin \\nAllergy). If concern exists regarding the safety of ceftriaxone \\nfor a person with HIV and neurosyphilis, skin testing should \\nbe performed to confirm penicillin allergy and, if necessary, \\npenicillin desensitization in consultation with a specialist is \\nrecommended. Other regimens have not been adequately \\nevaluated for treatment of neurosyphilis.\\nSyphilis During Pregnancy\\nAll women should be screened serologically for syphilis \\nat the first prenatal care visit ( 174), which is mandated by \\nthe majority of states (142). Among populations for whom \\nreceipt of prenatal care is not optimal, serologic screening and \\ntreatment (if serologic test is reactive) should be performed at \\nthe time of pregnancy testing (632). Antepartum screening can \\nbe performed by manual nontreponemal antibody testing (e.g., \\nRPR) by using the traditional syphilis screening algorithm or \\nby treponemal antibody testing (e.g., immunoassays) using the \\nreverse sequence algorithm.\\nPregnant women with positive treponemal screening tests \\n(e.g., EIA, CIA, or immunoblot) should have additional \\nquantitative nontreponemal testing because titers are essential \\nfor monitoring treatment response. Serologic testing should \\nalso be performed twice during the third trimester: at 28 weeks’ \\ngestation and at delivery for pregnant women who live in \\ncommunities with high rates of syphilis and for women who \\nhave been at risk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy.\\nMaternal risk factors for syphilis during pregnancy include \\nsex with multiple partners, sex in conjunction with drug \\nuse or transactional sex, late entry to prenatal care (i.e., first \\nvisit during the second trimester or later) or no prenatal \\ncare, methamphetamine or heroin use, incarceration of the \\nwoman or her partner, and unstable housing or homelessness \\n(174,633–636).

The risk for antepartum fetal infection or \\ncongenital syphilis at delivery is related to the syphilis stage \\nduring pregnancy, with the highest risk occurring during \\nthe primary and secondary stages. Quantitative maternal \\nnontreponemal titer, especially if >1:8, might be a marker of \\nearly infection and bacteremia. However, risk for fetal infection \\nis still substantial among pregnant women with late latent \\nsyphilis and low titers. Pregnant women with stable, serofast \\nlow nontreponemal titers who have previously been treated \\nfor syphilis might not require additional treatment; however, \\nincreasing or high antibody titers in a pregnant woman \\npreviously treated might indicate reinfection or treatment \\nfailure, and treatment should be offered.\\nIf an automated treponemal test (e.g., EIA or CIA) is used for \\nantepartum syphilis screening, all positive tests should be reflexed \\nto a quantitative nontreponemal test (e.g., RPR or VDRL). If \\nthe nontreponemal test is negative, the results are considered \\ndiscrepant and a second treponemal test (TP-PA is preferred) \\nshould be performed, preferably on the same specimen.\\nIf the second treponemal test is positive (e.g., EIA positive, \\nRPR negative, or TP-PA positive), current or previous syphilis \\ninfection can be confirmed. For women with a history of \\nadequately treated syphilis who do not have ongoing risk, no \\nfurther treatment is necessary. Women without a history of \\ntreatment should have the syphilis stage determined and should \\nbe treated accordingly with a recommended penicillin regimen.\\nIf the second treponemal test is negative (e.g., EIA positive, \\nRPR negative, or TP-PA negative), the positive EIA or CIA is \\nmore likely to represent a false-positive test result for women \\nwho are living in communities with low rates of syphilis, have \\na partner who is uninfected, and have no history of treated \\nsyphilis (637,638). If the woman is at low risk for syphilis, \\nlacks signs or symptoms of primary syphilis, has a partner \\nwith no clinical or serologic evidence of syphilis, and is likely \\nto follow up with clinical care, repeat serologic testing within \\n4 weeks can be considered to determine whether the EIA or CIA \\nremains positive or if the RPR, VDRL, or TP-PA result becomes \\npositive. If both the RPR and TP-PA remain negative, no further \\ntreatment is necessary. If follow-up is not likely, women with an \\nisolated reactive treponemal test and without a history of treated \\nsyphilis should be treated according to the syphilis stage.\\nTreatment\\nPenicillin G is the only known effective antimicrobial for \\ntreating fetal infection and preventing congenital syphilis \\n(639). Evidence is insufficient to determine the optimal \\npenicillin regimen during pregnancy (640).\\nRecommended Regimen for Syphilis During Pregnancy\\nPregnant women should be treated with the recommended penicillin \\nregimen for their stage of infection\\nOther Management Considerations\\nThe following recommendations should be considered for \\npregnant women with syphilis infection:\\n• Certain evidence indicates that additional therapy is \\nbeneficial for pregnant women to prevent congenital \\nsyphilis. For women who have primary, secondary, or early \\nlatent syphilis, a second dose of benzathine penicillin G \\n2.4 million units IM can be administered 1 week after the \\ninitial dose (641–643).\\n• When syphilis is diagnosed during the second half of \\npregnancy, management should include a sonographic fetal \\nevaluation for congenital syphilis. However, this evaluation \\nshould not delay therapy. Sonographic signs of fetal or \\nplacental syphilis (e.g., hepatomegaly, ascites, hydrops, fetal \\nanemia, or a thickened placenta) indicate a greater risk for \\nfetal treatment failure (644); cases accompanied by these \\nsigns should be managed in consultation with obstetric \\nspecialists. A second dose of benzathine penicillin G \\n2.4 million units IM after the initial dose might be beneficial \\nfor fetal treatment in these situations.\\n• Women treated for syphilis during the second half of \\npregnancy are at risk for premature labor or fetal distress \\nif the treatment precipitates the Jarisch-Herxheimer \\nreaction (590). These women should be advised to seek \\nobstetric attention after treatment if they notice any fever, \\ncontractions, or decrease in fetal movements. Stillbirth is \\na rare complication of treatment; however, concern for \\nthis complication should not delay necessary treatment. \\nNo data are available to support that corticosteroid \\ntreatment alters the risk for treatment-related complications \\nduring pregnancy.\\n• Missed doses >9 days between doses are not acceptable for \\npregnant women receiving therapy for late latent syphilis \\n(613). An optimal interval between doses is 7 days for \\npregnant women. If a pregnant woman does not return \\nfor the next dose on day 7, every effort should be made'),\n",

If syphilis is diagnosed and treated at or before 24 weeks’ \\ngestation, serologic titers should not be repeated before 8 weeks \\nafter treatment (e.g., at 32 weeks’ gestation) but should be \\nrepeated again at delivery. Titers should be repeated sooner \\nif reinfection or treatment failure is suspected. For syphilis \\ndiagnosed and treated after 24 weeks’ gestation, serologic titers \\nshould be repeated at delivery.\\nA majority of women will not achieve a fourfold decrease \\nin titers before delivery, although this does not indicate \\ntreatment failure (645). However, a fourfold increase in titer \\nafter treatment (e.g., from 1:8 to 1:32) that is sustained for \\n>2 weeks is concerning for reinfection or treatment failure. \\nNontreponemal titers can increase immediately after treatment, \\npresumably related to the treatment response. Therefore, unless \\nsymptoms and signs exist of primary or secondary syphilis, \\nfollow-up titer should not be repeated until approximately \\n8 weeks after treatment. Inadequate maternal treatment is \\nlikely if delivery occurs within 30 days of therapy, clinical signs \\nof infection are present at delivery, or the maternal antibody \\ntiter at delivery is fourfold higher than the pretreatment titer.\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nSee Syphilis, Management of Sex Partners.\\nSpecial Considerations\\nPenicillin Allergy\\nNo proven alternatives to penicillin are available for \\ntreatment of syphilis during pregnancy.

Erythromycin and \\nazithromycin should not be used because neither reliably cures \\nmaternal infection nor treats an infected fetus (640).

All \\nwomen with HIV infection should be evaluated for syphilis and \\nreceive a penicillin regimen appropriate for the syphilis stage. \\nData are insufficient to recommend any alternative regimens \\nfor pregnant women with syphilis and HIV infection (see \\nSyphilis Among Persons with HIV).\\nCongenital Syphilis\\nThe rate of reported congenital syphilis in the United States \\nhas increased dramatically since 2012. During 2019, a total of \\n1,870 cases of congenital syphilis were reported, including 94 \\nstillbirths and 34 infant deaths (141). The 2019 national rate \\nof 48.5 cases per 100,000 live births represents a 41% increase \\nrelative to 2018 (34.3 cases per 100,000 live births) and a 477% \\nincrease relative to 2012 (8.4 cases per 100,000 live births). \\nDuring 2015–2019, the rate of congenital syphilis increased \\n291.1% (12.4 to 48.5 per 100,000 live births), which mirrors \\nincreases in the rate of primary and secondary syphilis among \\nfemales aged 15–44 years (a 171.9% increase, from 3.2 to 8.7 \\nper 100,000 females).\\nEffective prevention and detection of congenital syphilis \\ndepend on identifying syphilis among pregnant women and, \\ntherefore, on the routine serologic screening of pregnant \\nwomen during the first prenatal visit and at 28 weeks’ gestation \\nand at delivery for women who live in communities with high \\nrates of syphilis, women with HIV infection, or those who \\nare at increased risk for syphilis acquisition.

In most clinical settings, patients \\nwho report a penicillin allergy are not treated with ß-lactam \\nantimicrobials. For patients with a diagnosis of gonorrhea and \\na concomitant reported allergy to penicillin, ceftriaxone is often \\navoided, even though the cross-reactivity between penicillin \\nallergy and third-generation cephalosporins is low (652–654).\\nPrevalence of reported allergy to penicillin is approximately \\n10% among the U.S. population and higher among hospital \\ninpatients and residents in health care–related facilities (655–\\n658). One large study in an STI clinic revealed that 8.3% of \\npatients reported penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic \\nallergy (659). Penicillin allergy is often overreported, with the \\nmajority of patients who report penicillin allergy able to tolerate \\nthe medication (660). The prevalence of reported penicillin \\nallergy in low-income countries is unknown; however, limited \\ndata indicate that penicillin is one of the most frequently \\nreported antibiotic allergies (661).\\nPatients often are incorrectly labeled as allergic to penicillin \\nand are therefore denied the benefit of a ß-lactam therapy. \\nThe presence of a penicillin allergy label considerably reduces \\nprescribing options for affected patients. Moreover, penicillin \\nallergy labels lead to the use of more expensive and less effective \\ndrugs and can result in adverse consequences, including longer \\nlength of hospital stay and increased risk for infection. Multiple \\nstudies have described that persons with reported penicillin or \\nanother ß-lactam antibiotic allergy have higher rates of surgical-\\nsite infections, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  \\ninfections, and higher medical care usage (653,662–664).\\nThe overreported prevalence of penicillin allergy is \\nsecondary to imprecise use of the term “allergy” by families \\nand clinicians and lack of clarity to differentiate between \\nimmunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, \\ndrug intolerances, and other idiosyncratic reactions that can \\noccur days after exposure. Approximately 80% of patients \\nwith a true IgE-mediated allergic reaction to penicillin have \\nlost the sensitivity after 10 years (658). Thus, patients with \\nrecent reactions are more likely to be allergic than patients \\nwith remote reactions, and patients who had allergic reactions \\nin the distant past might no longer be reactive.\\nIn a Baltimore, Maryland, STI clinic study, only 7.1% of \\nthe patients who reported allergy to penicillin or to another \\nß-lactam antibiotic had an objective positive test for penicillin \\nallergy (659). Moreover, in studies that have incorporated \\npenicillin skin testing and graded oral challenge among persons \\nwith reported penicillin allergy, the true rates of allergy are low, \\nranging from 1.5% to 6.1% (665–667). Studies in preoperative \\nsurgical patients with reported penicillin allergy, evaluated \\nfor cardiovascular surgery (668) or orthopedics (669), have \\nrates of skin test positivity <8.5%. However, when patients \\nwith high-risk penicillin allergy histories are excluded, 99% \\nof patients could receive ß-lactams. In hospitalized patients \\nand other populations with comorbidities, the typical rates of \\nvalidated penicillin allergy among patients who report a history \\nof penicillin allergy are 2.5%–9.0% (670–673).\\nCross-Reactivity with Cephalosporins\\nPenicillin and cephalosporins both contain a ß-lactam ring. \\nThis structural similarity has led to considerable confusion \\nregarding cross-reactivity of these drugs and the risks for \\nallergic reactions from cephalosporins among penicillin-\\nallergic patients. In most clinical settings, patients with \\nreported penicillin allergy are precluded from treatment \\nwith such cephalosporin antibiotics as ceftriaxone. Third-\\ngeneration cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone and cefixime) have \\nlower cross-reactivity with IgE-mediated penicillin-allergic \\npatients (<1%) compared with first- and second-generation \\ncephalosporins (range: 1%–8%). Moreover, anaphylaxis \\nsecondary to cephalosporins is extremely rare among persons \\nwho report a penicillin allergy and is estimated to occur at a rate \\nof one per 52,000 persons (652). Data from the Kaiser health \\ncare system reported that among 3,313 patients with self-\\nreported cephalosporin allergy who received a cephalosporin \\n(mostly first generation), no cases of anaphylaxis were reported \\n(652). Use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins \\nand carbapenems is safe for patients without a history of any \\nIgE-mediated symptoms (e.g., anaphylaxis or urticaria) from \\npenicillin during the preceding 10 years.\\nValidating Penicillin or Another ß-Lactam \\nAntibiotic Allergy\\nEvaluating a patient who reports a penicillin or another \\nß-lactam antibiotic allergy involves three steps: 1) obtaining \\na thorough medical history, including previous exposures to \\npenicillin or other ß-lactam antibiotics (658); 2) performing \\na skin test evaluation by using the penicillin major and minor \\ndeterminants; and 3) among those who have a negative \\npenicillin skin test, performing an observed oral challenge with \\n250 mg amoxicillin before proceeding directly to treatment \\nwith the indicated ß-lactam therapy (667,675).\\nFor persons who have a positive skin test reactive to penicillin \\n(either to the major or minor determinants), treatment with a \\nß-lactam antibiotic is not usually advised, and other effective \\nantimicrobials should be used (656,658). For persons among \\nwhom the only therapy option is a penicillin antibiotic (e.g., a \\npatient with neurosyphilis or a pregnant woman with syphilis) \\nand among whom a penicillin skin test is positive, induction \\nof penicillin tolerance (also referred to as desensitization) is \\nrequired (675).

Until recently, penicillin skin testing in the \\nUnited States only included the major determinant benzyl \\npenicillin poly-L-lysine (Pre-Pen) in addition to penicillin G. \\nThis test identifies approximately 90%–99% of the IgE-\\nmediated penicillin-allergic patients. Because the remaining \\n1%–10% of penicillin-allergic patients who are not captured \\nby this penicillin skin test are due to minor determinants IgE \\nantibodies, the standard practice is to follow skin testing with \\nan observed oral challenge of amoxicillin 250 mg with 1 hour \\nof observation. If the skin test and oral challenge are both \\nnegative, the risk for IgE-mediated anaphylaxis approaches zero \\nand is equivalent to that of a person who has never reported \\nan allergy to penicillin.\\nA revised version of the penicillin skin test kit, which includes \\nthe major determinant reagent Pre-Pen, minor determinants, \\nand amoxicillin, is being evaluated by FDA. This penicillin \\nskin test kit has been evaluated among 455 patients (677) \\nwith previous allergy history and has a negative predictive \\nvalue of 98%. If approved, this kit might eliminate the need \\nfor oral challenge.\\nPenicillin skin testing has become a clinically significant \\nelement in antibiotic stewardship programs, and the \\nprocedure has been increasingly used by hospital-based \\npharmacists, hospitalists, and infectious disease physicians \\n(670,672,673,678,679) as part of overall antibiotic stewardship \\ninterventions. When integrated into stewardship, the rates of \\nß-lactam antibiotic use increased substantially (670).\\nRecommendations\\nPersons with a history of severe adverse cutaneous \\nreaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal \\nnecrolysis) and other severe non–IgE-mediated reactions (e.g., \\ninterstitial nephritis or hemolytic anemia) are not candidates \\nfor penicillin skin testing or challenge. Penicillin and any \\nother ß-lactam antibiotics should be avoided indefinitely \\namong these patients, who should be referred to an allergy \\ncenter for further evaluation. Similarly, patients who deny \\npenicillin allergy, but who report previous IgE-type reactions \\nto cephalosporins, should be referred to an allergist for specific \\ncephalosporin testing.\\nIn a time of increasing antimicrobial resistance, following \\nrecommended use of antibiotic treatments is crucial. STI \\nprograms and clinicians should promote increased access to \\npenicillin allergy testing. Allergy testing is being provided \\nby clinicians in primary care and hospital settings. If \\nappropriate, STI programs and ambulatory settings should \\nconsider developing expanded access to penicillin or ß-lactam \\nallergy assessment.\\nPersons with high-risk symptom histories (e.g., anaphylaxis \\nwithin the previous 10 years) should not be administered \\npenicillin or a ß-lactam antibiotic in an ambulatory setting. \\nFurthermore, these persons with high-risk symptoms should \\nnot receive penicillin skin testing or amoxicillin oral challenge \\nin an ambulatory STI setting and should be referred to an \\nallergist for further evaluation.\\nHigh-risk symptom histories include development of \\nthe following after penicillin or ß-lactam administration: \\nanaphylaxis within 6 hours or severe adverse cutaneous reaction \\n(e.g., eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson \\nsyndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or acute generalized \\nexanthematous pustulosis) and other severe non–IgE-mediated \\nreactions (e.g., kidney or hepatic injury, hemolytic anemia, or \\nthrombocytopenia).\\nDirect Treatment Approach for Ceftriaxone\\nAmong persons with confirmed IgE-mediated penicillin \\nallergy, the level of cross-reactivity with third-generation \\ncephalosporins is low (652,680,681).

The \\nrisk for severe amoxicillin-mediated anaphylaxis has decreased \\nover time and is rare. In the United Kingdom during 1972–\\n2007, one fatal case of amoxicillin-medicated anaphylaxis was \\nreported (684).\\n Skin Testing for Penicillin Allergy\\nSkin testing for penicillin allergy should be performed if \\nany indication exists that the symptoms were secondary to an \\nIgE-mediated hypersensitivity. T esting is also indicated as a \\npotential diagnostic procedure to definitively rule out penicillin \\nallergy and document a negative allergy status in the medical \\nrecord (i.e., delabeling). Because penicillin allergy testing \\ndoes not test for multiple minor determinants, a person with \\na negative skin test should follow up with an oral challenge to \\nconfirm the negative status.\\nPersons with negative results of a penicillin skin test, followed by \\nan amoxicillin oral challenge, can receive conventional penicillin \\ntherapy safely if needed. Persons with positive skin test results and \\nfor whom no other clinical options exist (e.g., neurosyphilis and \\nsyphilis in a pregnant woman) should be referred to an allergist \\nand desensitized before initiating treatment.\\nTesting Procedures\\nPenicillin skin testing includes use of skin test reagents for \\nidentifying persons at risk for adverse reactions (Box 3), followed \\nby initial pinprick screening with penicillin major determinants \\n(Pre-Pen) and penicillin G, followed by intradermal testing if \\npinprick results are negative. Penicillin testing procedures are \\nperformed in accordance with the Pre-Pen test kit instructions \\n(https://penallergytest.com/wp-content/uploads/PRE-PEN-\\nPackage-Insert.pdf). Saline negative controls and histamine \\npositive controls are an integral part of the procedure. Penicillin \\nskin testing should not be performed for patients who have \\ntaken antihistamines within the past 7 days.\\nSkin testing can be safely performed by trained \\nnonallergists and has been implemented as an antimicrobial \\nstewardship intervention by internal medicine physicians, \\npharmacists, hospitalists, and infectious disease physicians \\n(670,673,678,679). Patients tested should also receive \\ndocumentation of status, and the results should be entered in \\nthe medical record.\\nPenicillin skin testing during pregnancy is considered safe. \\nFor pregnant persons who report a penicillin or ß-lactam \\nallergy, penicillin allergy is an important consideration in \\ntreating syphilis during pregnancy and the potential for group \\nB streptococcal infection and preoperative prophylaxis if a \\ncesarean delivery is required. However, oral challenges should \\nnot be performed unless in a setting where additional support \\nservices are available.\\nManaging Persons Being Tested\\nPatients who have a positive skin test should not receive \\nß-lactam drugs in the ambulatory setting and should be \\nreferred to an allergist or penicillin allergy expert for further \\nevaluation. The allergy testing results should be documented \\nin the medical record. Patients who test negative should be \\ninformed that their risk for anaphylaxis is extremely low and is \\nequivalent to a person who does not report an allergy history. If \\ntreatment with penicillin or ceftriaxone is indicated, it can be \\nadministered safely.

Signs of urethral \\ndischarge on examination can also be present among persons \\nwithout symptoms. Although N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis \\nare well established as clinically important infectious causes of \\nurethritis, M. genitalium  has been strongly associated with \\nurethritis and, less commonly, prostatitis (691–697). If POC \\ndiagnostic tools (e.g., Gram, methylene blue [MB], or gentian \\nviolet [GV] stain microscopy) are unavailable, drug regimens \\neffective against both gonorrhea and chlamydia should be \\nadministered. Further testing to determine the specific etiology \\nis recommended for preventing complications, reinfection, \\nand transmission because a specific diagnosis might improve \\ntreatment compliance, delivery of risk-reduction interventions, \\nand partner services. Both chlamydia and gonorrhea are \\nreportable to health departments. NAATs are preferred for \\ndetecting C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae, and urine is the \\npreferred specimen for males ( 553). NAAT-based tests for \\ndiagnosing T . vaginalis among men with urethritis have not \\nbeen cleared by FDA; however, laboratories have performed \\nthe CLIA-compliant validation studies (698) needed to provide \\nsuch testing.\\nEtiology\\nMultiple organisms can cause infectious urethritis. The \\npresence of gram-negative intracellular diplococci (GNID) \\nor purple intracellular diplococci (MB or GV) on urethral \\nsmear is indicative of presumed gonococcal infection, \\nwhich is frequently accompanied by chlamydial infection. \\nNongonococcal urethritis (NGU), which is diagnosed when \\nmicroscopy of urethral secretions indicate inflammation \\nwithout GNID or MB or GV purple intracellular diplococci, \\nis caused by C. trachomatis in 15%–40% of cases; however, \\nprevalence varies by age group, with a lower proportion of \\ndisease occurring among older men (699). Documentation of \\nchlamydial infection as NGU etiology is essential because of the \\nneed for partner referral for evaluation and treatment to prevent \\ncomplications of chlamydia, especially for female partners. \\nComplications of C. trachomatis –associated NGU among \\nmales include epididymitis, prostatitis, and reactive arthritis.\\nM. genitalium is associated with symptoms of urethritis and \\nurethral inflammation and accounts for 15%–25% of NGU \\ncases in the United States (691–693,696,697,700). Among \\nmen with symptoms of urethritis, M. genitalium was detected \\nin 11% of those with urethritis in Australia (701), 12%–15% \\nin the United Kingdom (702–704), 15% in South Africa (696), \\n19% in China (705), 21% in Korea, 22% in Japan (706), and \\n28.7% in the United States (range: 20.4%–38.8%) (697). Data \\nare inconsistent regarding other Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma \\nspecies as etiologic agents of urethritis (707). The majority \\nof men with Ureaplasma infections do not have overt disease \\nunless a high organism load is present.\\nT . vaginalis  can cause urethritis among heterosexual \\nmen; however, the prevalence varies substantially by U.S. \\ngeographic region, age, and sexual behavior and within specific \\npopulations. Studies among men with and without overt \\nurethritis in developed countries document relatively low \\nrates of T . vaginalis in the Netherlands (0.5%) (708), Japan \\n(1.3%) (706,709), the United States (2.4%) (710), and the \\nUnited Kingdom (3.6%) ( 703). Studies in other countries \\nhave documented higher rates, such as in Croatia (8.2%) \\n(711) and Zimbabwe (8.4%) ( 712), particularly among \\nsymptomatic patients.\\nNeisseria meningitidis  can colonize mucosal surfaces and \\ncause urethritis ( 713). Urogenital N. meningitidis  rates \\nand duration of carriage, prevalence of asymptomatic and \\nsymptomatic infection, and modes of transmission have \\nnot been systematically described; however, studies indicate \\nthat N. meningitidis  can be transmitted through oral-\\npenile contact (i.e., fellatio) ( 714–716).

In a retrospective review of 80 cases of HSV \\nurethritis in Australia (717), the majority of infections were \\nassociated with HSV-1 with clinical findings of meatitis (62%), \\ngenital ulceration (37%), and dysuria (20%). Adenovirus can \\npresent with dysuria, meatal inflammation, and conjunctivitis \\n(718). Enteric bacteria have been identified as an uncommon \\ncause of NGU and might be associated with insertive anal \\nintercourse (699).\\nOther bacterial pathogens have been implicated as potential \\ncauses of clinical urethritis, either in clustered case series or as \\nsporadic cases such as Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus \\nparainfluenzae (719–723). Haemophilus was identified in 12.6% \\nof cases among 413 men (mostly MSM reporting insertive oral \\nsex) (724), and high rates of azithromycin resistance (39.5%) \\nwere identified among Haemophilus urethritis patients (725). \\nIndividual case reports have linked NGU to multiple bacterial \\nspecies, including Corynebacterium propinquum (726), Kurthia \\ngibsonii (727), Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum (728,729), \\nCorynebacterium striatrium  ( 730), Aerococcus urinae  ( 731), \\nand Neisseria elongata (732).

The microscopy \\ndiagnostic cutoff might vary, depending on background \\nprevalence (≥2 WBCs/high power field [HPF] in high-\\nprevalence settings [STI clinics] or ≥5 WBCs/HPF in \\nlower-prevalence settings).§§\\n§§ For urethral microscopy, the cutoff for diagnosing urethritis is ≥2 WBCs/HPF \\n(Sources: Rietmeijer CA, Mettenbrink CJ.

C. trachomatis has been well established \\nas an NGU etiology; however, prevalence varies across \\npopulations and accounts for <50% of overall cases (712,740–\\n742). M. genitalium is estimated to account for 10%–25% of \\ncases (696,697,701,703,704,706,733,743), and T . vaginalis \\nfor 1%–8% of cases depending on population and location \\n(703,706,708,710,712). Other etiologies include different \\nbacteria, such as Haemophilus species (724,725), N. meningitidis \\n(713,716), HSV (706,717), and adenovirus (744). However, \\neven when extensive testing is performed, no pathogens are \\nidentified in approximately half of cases (701,733).\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nClinical presentation can include urethral discharge, \\nirritation, dysuria, or meatal pruritus (697,743,745). NGU is \\nconfirmed for symptomatic men when diagnostic evaluation of \\nurethral secretions indicates inflammation, without evidence \\nof diplococci by Gram, MB, or GV smear on microscopy \\n(712,746,747). Visible discharge or secretions can be collected \\nby a swab without inserting it into the urethra; if no visible \\nsecretions, the swab can be inserted into the urethral meatus \\nand rotated, making contact with the urethral wall before \\nremoval. If microscopy is unavailable, urine testing for \\nleukocyte esterase can be performed on first-void urine, and \\nmicroscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-void \\nurine demonstrating ≥10 WBCs/HPF has a high negative \\npredictive value.\\nAll men who have suspected or confirmed NGU should \\nbe tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea by using NAATs. \\nA specific diagnosis can potentially reduce complications, \\nreinfection, and transmission. M. genitalium testing should be \\nperformed for men who have persistent or recurrent symptoms \\nafter initial empiric treatment. T esting for T . vaginalis should \\nbe considered in areas or among populations with high \\nprevalence, in cases where a partner is known to be infected, \\nor for men who have persistent or recurrent symptoms after \\ninitial empiric treatment.\\nTreatment\\nIdeally, treatment should be pathogen based; however, \\ndiagnostic information might not be immediately available. \\nPresumptive treatment should be initiated at NGU diagnosis. \\nDoxycycline is highly effective for chlamydial urethral \\ninfections and is also effective for chlamydial infections of \\nthe rectum; it also has some activity against M. genitalium. \\nIn contrast, reports have increased of azithromycin treatment \\nfailures for chlamydial infection (748,749), and the incidence \\nof macrolide resistance in M. genitalium also has been rapidly \\nrising (697,702,705,750,751).

T o avoid reinfection, sex partners \\nshould abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their \\npartners are treated.\\nPersistent or Recurrent Nongonococcal Urethritis\\nThe objective diagnosis of persistent or recurrent NGU \\nshould be made before considering additional antimicrobial \\ntherapy. Symptomatic recurrent or persistent urethritis might \\nbe caused by treatment failure or reinfection after successful \\ntreatment. Among men who have persistent symptoms after \\ntreatment without objective signs of urethral inflammation, the \\nvalue of extending the duration of antimicrobials has not been \\ndemonstrated. T reatment failure for chlamydial urethritis has \\nbeen estimated at 6%–12% (755). The most common cause \\nof persistent or recurrent NGU is M. genitalium, especially \\nafter doxycycline therapy (756,757). T reatment failure for \\nM. genitalium  is harder to determine because certain men \\nachieve clinical cure (i.e., resolution of symptoms) but can \\nstill have detectable M. genitalium in urethral specimens (758).\\nThe initial step in recurrent urethritis is assessing compliance \\nwith treatment or potential reexposure to an untreated sex \\npartner (697,743). If the patient did not comply with the \\ntreatment regimen or was reexposed to an untreated partner, \\nretreatment with the initial regimen can be considered. If \\ntherapy was appropriately completed and no reexposure \\noccurred, therapy is dependent on the initial treatment \\nregimen. Ideally, diagnostic testing among men with recurrent \\nor persistent symptoms, including those with gonorrhea, \\nchlamydia, M. genitalium, and trichomoniasis, can be used to \\nguide further management decisions.\\nT . vaginalis is also known to cause urethritis among men who \\nhave sex with women. In areas where T . vaginalis is prevalent, \\nmen who have sex with women with persistent or recurrent \\nurethritis should be tested for T . vaginalis and presumptively \\ntreated with metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose or \\ntinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose; their partners should be \\nreferred for evaluation and treatment, if needed.\\nIf T . vaginalis is unlikely (MSM with NGU or negative \\nT . vaginalis NAAT), men with recurrent NGU should be tested \\nfor M. genitalium by using an FDA-cleared NAAT . T reatment \\nfor M. genitalium includes a two-stage approach, ideally using \\nresistance-guided therapy. If M. genitalium resistance testing is \\navailable it should be performed, and the results should be used \\nto guide therapy (see Mycoplasma genitalium). If M. genitalium \\nresistance testing is not available, doxycycline 100 mg orally \\n2 times/day for 7 days followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally \\nonce daily for 7 days should be used. The rationale for this \\napproach is that although not curative, doxycycline decreases \\nthe M. genitalium bacterial load, thereby increasing likelihood \\nof moxifloxacin success (759). Higher doses of azithromycin \\nhave not been effective for M. genitalium after azithromycin \\ntreatment failures. Men with persistent or recurrent NGU after \\ntreatment for M. genitalium or T . vaginalis should be referred \\nto an infectious disease or urology specialist.\\nSpecial Considerations\\nHIV Infection\\nNGU might facilitate HIV transmission (760).

Cervicitis frequently is asymptomatic; \\nhowever, certain women might report an abnormal vaginal \\ndischarge and intermenstrual vaginal bleeding (e.g., especially \\nafter sexual intercourse). The criterion of using an increased \\nnumber of WBCs on endocervical Gram stain in the diagnosis \\nof cervicitis has not been standardized; it is not sensitive, \\nhas a low positive predictive value for C. trachomatis  and \\nN. gonorrhoeae infections, and is not available in most clinical \\nsettings (297,761). Leukorrhea, defined as >10 WBCs/HPF on \\nmicroscopic examination of vaginal fluid, might be a sensitive \\nindicator of cervical inflammation with a high negative \\npredictive value (i.e., cervicitis is unlikely in the absence of \\nleukorrhea) (762,763). Finally, although the presence of gram-\\nnegative intracellular diplococci on Gram stain of endocervical \\nexudate might be specific for diagnosing gonococcal cervical \\ninfection when evaluated by an experienced laboratorian, it is \\nnot a sensitive indicator of infection (764).\\nEtiology\\nC. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae is the most common etiology \\nof cervicitis defined by diagnostic testing. T richomoniasis, \\ngenital herpes (especially primary HSV-2 infection), or \\nM. genitalium ( 761,765–768) also have been associated \\nwith cervicitis. However, in many cases of cervicitis, no \\norganism is isolated, especially among women at relatively \\nlow risk for recent acquisition of these STIs (e.g., women aged \\n>30 years) (769). Limited data indicate that BV and frequent \\ndouching might cause cervicitis (770–772). The majority \\nof persistent cases of cervicitis are not caused by reinfection \\nwith C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae; other factors might \\nbe involved (e.g., persistent abnormality of vaginal flora, \\nM. genitalium, douching or exposure to other types of chemical \\nirritants, dysplasia, or idiopathic inflammation in the zone of \\nectopy). Available data do not indicate an association between \\ngroup B streptococcus colonization and cervicitis (773,774). \\nNo specific evidence exists for a role for Ureaplasma parvum or \\nUreaplasma urealyticum in cervicitis (707,761,765,775,776).\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nBecause cervicitis might be a sign of upper genital tract \\ninfection (e.g., endometritis), women should be assessed for \\nsigns of PID and tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae \\nwith NAAT on vaginal, cervical, or urine samples ( 553) (see \\nChlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections). Women \\nwith cervicitis also should be evaluated for concomitant BV \\nand trichomoniasis. Because sensitivity of microscopy for \\ndetecting T . vaginalis is relatively low (approximately 50%), \\nsymptomatic women with cervicitis and negative wet-mount \\nmicroscopy for trichomonads should receive further testing \\n(i.e., NAAT , culture, or other FDA-cleared diagnostic test) \\n(see T richomoniasis). T esting for M. genitalium with the FDA-\\ncleared NAAT can be considered. Although HSV-2 infection \\nhas been associated with cervicitis, the utility of specific testing \\n(i.e., PCR or culture) for HSV-2 is unknown. T esting for \\nU. parvum, U. urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, or genital \\nculture for group B streptococcus is not recommended.\\nTreatment\\nMultiple factors should affect the decision to provide \\npresumptive therapy for cervicitis. Presumptive treatment with \\nantimicrobials for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae should \\nbe provided for women at increased risk (e.g., those aged \\n<25 years and women with a new sex partner, a sex partner \\nwith concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI), if \\nfollow-up cannot be ensured, or if testing with NAAT is not \\npossible. T richomoniasis and BV should be treated if detected \\n(see Bacterial Vaginosis; T richomoniasis). For women at lower \\nrisk for STIs, deferring treatment until results of diagnostic \\ntests are available is an option. If treatment is deferred and \\nC. trachomatis  and N. gonorrhoeae  NAATs are negative, a \\nfollow-up visit to determine whether the cervicitis has resolved \\ncan be considered.\\nRecommended Regimen for Cervicitis*\\nDoxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days\\n*  Consider concurrent treatment for gonococcal infection if the patient is \\nat risk for gonorrhea or lives in a community where the prevalence of \\ngonorrhea is high (see Gonococcal Infections).\\nAlternative Regimen\\nAzithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose\\nOther Management Considerations\\nT o minimize transmission and reinfection, women treated \\nfor cervicitis should be instructed to abstain from sexual \\nintercourse until they and their partners have been treated \\n(i.e., until completion of a 7-day regimen or for 7 days after \\nsingle-dose therapy) and symptoms have resolved.

Women with a specific diagnosis of \\nchlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered \\npartner services and instructed to return in 3 months after \\ntreatment for repeat testing because of high rates of reinfection, \\nregardless of whether their sex partners were treated (753). If \\nsymptoms persist or recur, women should be instructed to \\nreturn for reevaluation.\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nManagement of sex partners of women treated for cervicitis \\nshould be tailored for the specific infection identified or \\nsuspected. All sex partners during the previous 60 days should \\nbe referred for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment \\nif chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis was identified. EPT \\nand other effective partner referral strategies are alternative \\napproaches for treating male partners of women who have \\nchlamydial or gonococcal infection (125–127) (see Partner \\nServices). T o avoid reinfection, sex partners should abstain \\nfrom sexual intercourse until they and their partners are treated.\\nPersistent or Recurrent Cervicitis\\nWomen with persistent or recurrent cervicitis despite \\nantimicrobial therapy should be reevaluated for possible \\nreexposure or treatment failure. If relapse or reinfection with \\na specific infection has been excluded, BV is not present, and \\nsex partners have been evaluated and treated, management \\noptions for persistent cervicitis are undefined. In addition, \\nthe usefulness of repeated or prolonged administration of \\nantimicrobial therapy for persistent symptomatic cervicitis \\nremains unknown. The etiology of persistent cervicitis, \\nincluding the potential role of M. genitalium (777), is unclear. \\nM. genitalium might be considered for cases of cervicitis that \\npersist after azithromycin or doxycycline therapy in which \\nreexposure to an infected partner or medical nonadherence is \\nunlikely. Among women with persistent cervicitis who were \\npreviously treated with doxycycline or azithromycin, testing \\nfor M. genitalium can be considered and treatment initiated on \\nthe basis of results of diagnostic testing (318) (see Mycoplasma \\ngenitalium). For women with persistent symptoms that are \\nclearly attributable to cervicitis, referral to a gynecologic \\nspecialist can be considered for evaluation of noninfectious \\ncauses (e.g., cervical dysplasia or polyps) (778).\\nSpecial Considerations\\nHIV Infection\\nWomen with cervicitis and HIV infection should receive \\nthe same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV . \\nCervicitis can increase cervical HIV shedding, and treatment \\nreduces HIV shedding from the cervix and thereby might \\nreduce HIV transmission to susceptible sex partners (779–783).\\nPregnancy\\nDiagnosis and treatment of cervicitis for pregnant women \\ndoes not differ from that for women who are not pregnant (see \\nDiagnostic Considerations; T reatment).\\nContraceptive Management\\nAccording to U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive \\nUse, 2016, leaving an IUD in place during treatment for \\ncervicitis is advisable (58). However, current recommendations \\nspecify that an IUD should not be placed if active cervicitis \\nis diagnosed (59).\\nChlamydial Infections\\nChlamydial Infection Among \\nAdolescents and Adults\\nChlamydial infection is the most frequently reported \\nbacterial infectious disease in the United States, and prevalence \\nis highest among persons aged ≤24 years (141,784). Multiple \\nsequelae can result from C. trachomatis  infection among \\nwomen, the most serious of which include PID, ectopic \\npregnancy, and infertility. Certain women who receive a \\ndiagnosis of uncomplicated cervical infection already have \\nsubclinical upper genital tract infection.\\nAsymptomatic infection is common among both men and \\nwomen. T o detect chlamydial infection, health care providers \\nfrequently rely on screening tests. Annual screening of all \\nsexually active women aged <25 years is recommended, as is \\nscreening of older women at increased risk for infection (e.g., \\nwomen aged ≥25 years who have a new sex partner, more \\nthan one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, \\nor a sex partner who has an STI) (149). In a community-\\nbased cohort of female college students, incident chlamydial \\ninfection was also associated with BV and high-risk HPV \\ninfection (785). Although chlamydia incidence might be higher \\namong certain women aged ≥25 years in certain communities, \\noverall, the largest proportion of infection is among women \\naged <25 years (141).\\nChlamydia screening programs have been demonstrated \\nto reduce PID rates among women ( 786,787). Although \\nevidence is insufficient to recommend routine screening for \\nC. trachomatis among sexually active young men because of \\ncertain factors (i.e., feasibility, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness), \\nscreening of sexually active young men should be considered \\nin clinical settings with a high prevalence of chlamydia (e.g., \\nadolescent clinics, correctional facilities, or STD specialty \\nclinics) or for populations with a high burden of infection \\n(e.g., MSM) (149,788).

More frequent screening than annual for \\ncertain women (e.g., adolescents) or certain men (e.g., MSM) \\nmight be indicated on the basis of risk behaviors.\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nFor women,  C. trachomatis  urogenital infection can be \\ndiagnosed by vaginal or cervical swabs or first-void urine. For \\nmen, C. trachomatis urethral infection can be diagnosed by \\ntesting first-void urine or a urethral swab. NAATs are the most \\nsensitive tests for these specimens and are the recommended \\ntest for detecting C. trachomatis infection (553). NAATs that \\nare FDA cleared for use with vaginal swab specimens can be \\ncollected by a clinician or patient in a clinical setting. Patient-\\ncollected vaginal swab specimens are equivalent in sensitivity \\nand specificity to those collected by a clinician using NAATs \\n(792,793), and this screening strategy is highly acceptable \\namong women ( 794,795). Optimal urogenital specimen \\ntypes for chlamydia screening by using NAAT include first-\\ncatch urine (for men) and vaginal swabs (for women) (553). \\nRecent studies have demonstrated that among men, NAAT \\nperformance on self-collected meatal swabs is comparable \\nto patient-collected urine or provider-collected urethral \\nswabs (796–798). Patient collection of a meatal swab for \\nC. trachomatis testing might be a reasonable approach for men \\nwho are either unable to provide urine or prefer to collect their \\nown meatal swab over providing urine. Previous evidence \\nindicates that the liquid-based cytology specimens collected for \\nPap smears might be acceptable specimens for NAAT , although \\ntest sensitivity using these specimens might be lower than that \\nassociated with use of cervical or vaginal swab specimens (799); \\nregardless, certain NAATs have been cleared by FDA for use \\non liquid-based cytology specimens.\\nRectal and oropharyngeal C. trachomatis infection among \\npersons engaging in receptive anal or oral intercourse can be \\ndiagnosed by testing at the anatomic exposure site. NAATs \\nhave been demonstrated to have improved sensitivity and \\nspecificity, compared with culture, for detecting C. trachomatis \\nat rectal and oropharyngeal sites (553,800–804), and certain \\nNAAT platforms have been cleared by FDA for these \\nanatomic sites (805). Data indicate that NAAT performance \\non self-collected rectal swabs is comparable to clinician-\\ncollected rectal swabs, and this specimen collection strategy \\nfor rectal C. trachomatis screening is highly acceptable among \\nmen (217,806). Self-collected rectal swabs are a reasonable \\nalternative to clinician-collected rectal swabs for C. trachomatis \\nscreening by NAAT , especially when clinicians are not available \\nor when self-collection is preferred over clinician collection. \\nAnnual screening for rectal C. trachomatis infection should \\nbe performed among men who report sexual activity at the \\nrectal site. Extragenital chlamydial testing at the rectal site \\ncan be considered for females on the basis of reported sexual \\nbehaviors and exposure through shared clinical decision-\\nmaking by the patient and the provider. The majority of \\npersons with C. trachomatis detected at oropharyngeal sites do \\nnot have oropharyngeal symptoms. The clinical significance of \\noropharyngeal C. trachomatis infection is unclear, and prevalence \\nis low, even among populations at high risk. However, when \\ngonorrhea testing is performed at the oropharyngeal site, \\nchlamydia test results might be reported because certain NAATs \\ndetect both bacteria from a single specimen.\\nPOC tests for C. trachomatis among asymptomatic persons \\ncan expedite treatment of infected persons and their sex \\npartners. Among symptomatic patients, POC tests for \\nC. trachomatis can optimize treatment by limiting unnecessary \\npresumptive treatment at the time of clinical decision-making \\nand improve antimicrobial stewardship. Thus, using a POC \\ntest will likely be a cost-effective diagnostic strategy for \\nC. trachomatis infection (807). Newer NAAT-based POC tests \\nhave promising performance and are becoming commercially \\navailable (807–809).\\nTreatment\\nT reating persons with C. trachomatis  prevents adverse \\nreproductive health complications and continued sexual \\ntransmission. Furthermore, treating their sex partners \\ncan prevent reinfection and infection of other partners. \\nT reating pregnant women usually prevents transmission of \\nC. trachomatis to neonates during birth. T reatment should be \\nprovided promptly for all persons with chlamydial infection; \\ntreatment delays have been associated with complications (e.g., \\nPID) in a limited proportion of women (810).\\nRecommended Regimen for Chlamydial Infection Among \\nAdolescents and Adults\\nDoxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days\\nAlternative Regimens\\nAzithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose\\nor\\nLevofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 7 days\\nA meta-analysis and a Cochrane systematic review evaluated \\ndata from randomized clinical trials of azithromycin versus \\ndoxycycline for treating urogenital chlamydial infection \\ndetermined that microbiologic treatment failure among men \\nwas higher for azithromycin than for doxycycline (748,749).'),\n",

A randomized trial \\nfor the treatment of rectal chlamydia infection among MSM \\nreported microbiologic cure was 100% with doxycycline and \\n74% with azithromycin (812). A published review reported \\nthat C. trachomatis was detected at the anorectal site among \\n33%–83% of women who had urogenital C. trachomatis  \\ninfection, and its detection was not associated with report of \\nreceptive anorectal sexual activity (813).\\nAlthough the clinical significance of oropharyngeal \\nC. trachomatis infection is unclear and routine oropharyngeal \\nscreening is not recommended, oropharyngeal C. trachomatis \\ncan be sexually transmitted to genital sites (211,814); therefore, \\nif C. trachomatis is identified from an oropharyngeal specimen \\nwhile screening for pharyngeal gonorrhea, it should be treated. \\nEvidence is limited regarding the efficacy of antimicrobial \\nregimens for oropharyngeal chlamydia; however, a recently \\npublished observational study indicates doxycycline might \\nbe more efficacious than azithromycin for oropharyngeal \\nchlamydia (815).\\nAvailable evidence supports that doxycycline is efficacious \\nfor C. trachomatis  infections of urogenital, rectal, and \\noropharyngeal sites. Although azithromycin maintains high \\nefficacy for urogenital C. trachomatis infection among women, \\nconcern exists regarding effectiveness of azithromycin for \\nconcomitant rectal C. trachomatis infection, which can occur \\ncommonly among women and cannot be predicted by reported \\nsexual activity. Inadequately treated rectal C. trachomatis  \\ninfection among women who have urogenital chlamydia \\ncan increase the risk for transmission and place women at \\nrisk for repeat urogenital C. trachomatis  infection through \\nautoinoculation from the anorectal site (816). Doxycycline is \\nalso available in a delayed-release 200-mg tablet formulation, \\nwhich requires once-daily dosing for 7 days and is as effective \\nas doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days for treating \\nurogenital C. trachomatis infection in men and women. It is \\nmore costly but also has lower frequency of gastrointestinal \\nside effects (817). Levofloxacin is an effective treatment \\nalternative but is more expensive. Erythromycin is no longer \\nrecommended because of the frequency of gastrointestinal side \\neffects, which can result in nonadherence. When nonadherence \\nto doxycycline regimen is a substantial concern, azithromycin \\n1 g regimen is an alternative treatment option but might \\nrequire posttreatment evaluation and testing because it has \\ndemonstrated lower treatment efficacy among persons with \\nrectal infection.\\nAmong persons receiving multidose regimens, medication \\nshould be dispensed with all doses involved, on-site and in \\nthe clinic, and the first dose should be directly observed. T o \\nmaximize adherence with recommended therapies, on-site, \\ndirectly observed single-dose therapy with azithromycin should \\nalways be available for persons for whom adherence with \\nmultiday dosing is a considerable concern.\\nOther Management Considerations\\nT o minimize disease transmission to sex partners, persons \\ntreated for chlamydia should be instructed to abstain from \\nsexual intercourse for 7 days after single-dose therapy or until \\ncompletion of a 7-day regimen and resolution of symptoms if \\npresent. T o minimize risk for reinfection, patients also should \\nbe instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until all of their \\nsex partners have been treated. Persons who receive a diagnosis \\nof chlamydia should be tested for HIV , gonorrhea, and syphilis. \\nMSM who are HIV negative with a rectal chlamydia diagnosis \\nshould be offered HIV PrEP .\\nFollow-Up\\nT est of cure to detect therapeutic failure (i.e., repeat testing \\n4 weeks after completing therapy) is not advised for nonpregnant \\npersons treated with the recommended or alternative regimens, \\nunless therapeutic adherence is in question, symptoms persist, \\nor reinfection is suspected. Moreover, using chlamydial NAATs \\nat <4 weeks after completion of therapy is not recommended \\nbecause the continued presence of nonviable organisms \\n(553,818,819) can lead to false-positive results.\\nA high prevalence of C. trachomatis  infection has been \\nobserved among women and men who were treated \\nfor chlamydial infection during the preceding months \\n(753,755,820–822). The majority of posttreatment infections \\ndo not result from treatment failure but rather from reinfection \\ncaused by failure of sex partners to receive treatment or \\ninitiation of sexual activity with a new infected partner (823), \\nindicating a need for improved education and treatment of \\nsex partners. Repeat infections confer an elevated risk for PID \\nand other complications among women. Men and women \\nwho have been treated for chlamydia should be retested \\napproximately 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether \\nthey believe their sex partners were treated; scheduling the \\nfollow-up visit at the time of treatment is encouraged (753). \\nIf retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest \\nwhenever persons next seek medical care <12 months after \\ninitial treatment.\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nSex partners should be referred for evaluation, testing, and \\npresumptive treatment if they had sexual contact with the \\npartner during the 60 days preceding the patient’s onset of \\nsymptoms or chlamydia diagnosis.

As an alternative, prevention efforts should \\nfocus on prenatal screening for C. trachomatis, including\\n• screening pregnant women at risk for C. trachomatis  \\ninfection at the first prenatal visit (e.g., women aged \\n<25 years and those aged ≥25 years who have a new sex \\npartner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with \\nconcurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI);\\n• treating all pregnant women with C. trachomatis during \\npregnancy and performing a test of cure 4 weeks after \\ntreatment to verify chlamydial eradication; these women \\nshould also be retested 3 months after treatment and again \\nin the third trimester or at time of delivery, and their \\npartners should also be tested and treated;\\n• retesting pregnant women during the third trimester who \\ninitially tested negative but remained at increased risk for \\nacquiring infection (e.g., women aged <25 years and those \\naged ≥25 years who have a new sex partner, more than one \\nsex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a \\nsex partner who has an STI); and\\n• screening at delivery those pregnant women who were not \\nscreened for C. trachomatis during pregnancy if at risk or \\nwho had no prenatal care; physicians and others caring \\nfor the mother and the newborn should communicate to \\nensure follow-up on the results of laboratory tests \\nperformed at delivery, and if positive, prompt and age-\\nappropriate treatment for the newborn and the mother.\\nNeonates born to mothers for whom prenatal chlamydia \\nscreening has been confirmed and the results are negative are \\nnot at high risk for infection.\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nSensitive and specific methods for diagnosing chlamydial \\nophthalmia in the neonate include both tissue culture and \\nnonculture tests (e.g., DFA tests and NAATs). DFA is the \\nonly nonculture FDA-cleared test for detecting chlamydia \\nfrom conjunctival swabs. NAATs are not cleared by FDA for \\ndetecting chlamydia from conjunctival swabs, and clinical \\nlaboratories should verify the procedure according to CLIA \\nregulations.

Urethral infections caused by \\nN. gonorrhoeae can produce symptoms among men that cause \\nthem to seek curative treatment soon enough to prevent \\nsequelae, but often not soon enough to prevent transmission \\nto others. Among women, gonococcal infections are commonly \\nasymptomatic or might not produce recognizable symptoms \\nuntil complications (e.g., PID) have occurred. PID can result in \\ntubal scarring that can lead to infertility or ectopic pregnancy.\\nAnnual screening for N. gonorrhoeae infection is recommended \\nfor all sexually active women aged <25 years and for older \\nwomen at increased risk for infection (e.g., those aged ≥25 years \\nwho have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex \\npartner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has \\nan STI) (149). Additional risk factors for gonorrhea include \\ninconsistent condom use among persons who are not in \\nmutually monogamous relationships, previous or coexisting \\nSTIs, and exchanging sex for money or drugs. Clinicians \\nshould consider the communities they serve and consult local \\npublic health authorities for guidance regarding identifying \\ngroups at increased risk. Gonococcal infection, in particular, is \\nconcentrated in specific geographic locations and communities. \\nMSM at high risk for gonococcal infection (e.g., those with \\nmultiple anonymous partners or substance abuse) or those at \\nrisk for HIV acquisition should be screened at all anatomic \\nsites of exposure every 3–6 months (see Men Who Have Sex \\nwith Men). At least annual screening is recommended for all \\nMSM. Screening for gonorrhea among heterosexual men and \\nwomen aged >25 years who are at low risk for infection is \\nnot recommended (149). A recent travel history with sexual \\ncontacts outside the United States should be part of any \\ngonorrhea evaluation.\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nSpecific microbiologic diagnosis of N. gonorrhoeae infection \\nshould be performed for all persons at risk for or suspected of \\nhaving gonorrhea; a specific diagnosis can potentially reduce \\ncomplications, reinfections, and transmission. Culture, NAAT , \\nand POC NAAT , such as GeneXpert (Cepheid), are available \\nfor detecting genitourinary infection with N. gonorrhoeae  \\n(149); culture requires endocervical (women) or urethral \\n(men) swab specimens. Culture is also available for detecting \\nrectal, oropharyngeal, and conjunctival gonococcal infection. \\nNAATs and POC NAATs) allow for the widest variety of \\nFDA-cleared specimen types, including endocervical and \\nvaginal swabs and urine for women, urethral swabs and urine \\nfor men, and rectal swabs and pharyngeal swabs for men and \\nwomen (www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/K121710.\\npdf). However, product inserts for each NAAT manufacturer \\nshould be consulted carefully because collection methods \\nand specimen types vary. Certain NAATs that have been \\ndemonstrated to detect commensal Neisseria species might \\nhave comparable low specificity when testing oropharyngeal \\nspecimens for N. gonorrhoeae  ( 553). NAAT sensitivity for \\ndetecting N. gonorrhoeae  from urogenital and nongenital \\nanatomic sites is superior to culture but varies by NAAT type \\n(553,800–803). For urogenital infections, optimal specimen \\ntypes for gonorrhea screening using NAATs include first-void \\nurine for men and vaginal swab specimens for women (553). \\nPatient-collected samples can be used in place of provider-\\ncollected samples in clinical settings when testing by NAAT \\nfor urine (men and women), vaginal swabs, rectal swabs, and \\noropharyngeal swabs after patient instructions have been \\nprovided (209,806,839–842).

In 1986, the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance \\nProject (GISP), a national sentinel surveillance system, was \\nestablished to monitor trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities \\nof urethral N. gonorrhoeae  strains in the United States \\n(849). The epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance guides \\ndecisions about gonococcal treatment recommendations \\nand has evolved because of shifts in antimicrobial resistance \\npatterns. During 2007, emergence of fluoroquinolone-\\nresistant N. gonorrhoeae in the United States prompted CDC \\nto cease recommending fluoroquinolones for gonorrhea \\ntreatment, leaving cephalosporins as the only remaining \\nclass of antimicrobials available for gonorrhea treatment in \\nthe United States (850). Reflecting concern about emerging \\ngonococcal resistance, CDC’s 2010 STD treatment guidelines \\nrecommended dual therapy for gonorrhea with a cephalosporin \\nplus either azithromycin or doxycycline, even if NAAT for \\nC. trachomatis was negative at the time of treatment (851). \\nHowever, during 2006–2011, the minimum concentrations of \\ncefixime needed to inhibit in vitro growth of the N. gonorrhoeae \\nstrains circulating in the United States and other countries \\nincreased, demonstrating that cefixime effectiveness might be \\nwaning (851). In addition, treatment failures with cefixime or \\nother oral cephalosporins were reported in Asia (852–855), \\nEurope (856–860), South Africa (861), and Canada (862,863). \\nDuring that time, case reports of ceftriaxone treatment failures \\nfor pharyngeal infections reported in Australia (864,865), \\nJapan ( 866 ), and Europe were concerning ( 856 ,867 ). \\nConsequently, CDC no longer recommends cefixime as a \\nfirst-line regimen for gonorrhea treatment in the United \\nStates (868). Since 2013, the proportion of GISP isolates \\nthat demonstrate reduced susceptibility (minimal inhibitory \\nconcentration [MIC] ≥2.0 µg/mL) to azithromycin has \\nincreased almost tenfold, to 5.1% in 2019 (141). Unlike the \\nappearance of ciprofloxacin resistance in the early 2000s, and \\ncefixime reduced-susceptibility isolates during 2010–2011, \\nemergence of azithromycin resistance is not concentrated \\namong certain populations (e.g., MSM in the western United \\nStates). Azithromycin has unique pharmacokinetic properties \\nthat might predispose to resistance due to its prolonged half-life \\n(869,870). With the exception of a small cluster of gonorrhea \\nstrains with azithromycin resistance and reduced susceptibility \\nto cefixime and ceftriaxone among seven patients during 2016, \\nall gonorrhea strains identified by GISP are susceptible to \\neither or both azithromycin and ceftriaxone or cefixime. In \\naddition, since 2013, antimicrobial stewardship has become \\nan urgent public health concern in the United States as \\ndescribed in Antimicrobial Resistant Threats in the United States \\n(871). Emergence of azithromycin resistance is not isolated to \\nN. gonorrhoeae; it has also been demonstrated in M. genitalium \\nand such enteric pathogens as Shigella and Campylobacter (see \\nMycoplasma genitalium; Proctitis, Proctocolitis, and Enteritis). \\nFinally, concern exists regarding azithromycin treatment \\nefficacy for chlamydia (see Chlamydial Infections).\\nDual therapy for gonococcal infection with ceftriaxone and \\nazithromycin recommended in previous guidance might have \\nmitigated emergence of reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone in \\nN. gonorrhoeae; however, concerns regarding potential harm to \\nthe microbiome and the effect on other pathogens diminishes \\nthe benefits of maintaining dual therapy. Consequently, only \\nceftriaxone is recommended for treating gonorrhea in the \\nUnited States (872). Clinicians remaining vigilant for treatment \\nfailures is paramount, and CDC plans to continue to monitor \\nfor changing ceftriaxone MICs until additional antimicrobials \\nor a vaccine is available.

Few antimicrobial \\nregimens reliably cure >90% of gonococcal pharyngeal \\ninfections (883,884).

Any \\nperson with pharyngeal gonorrhea should return 7–14 days \\nafter initial treatment for a test of cure by using either culture or \\nNAAT; however, testing at 7 days might result in an increased \\nlikelihood of false-positive tests. If the NAAT is positive, effort \\nshould be made to perform a confirmatory culture before \\nretreatment, especially if a culture was not already collected. All \\npositive cultures for test of cure should undergo antimicrobial \\nsusceptibility testing. Symptoms that persist after treatment \\nshould be evaluated by culture for N. gonorrhoeae (with or \\nwithout simultaneous NAAT) and antimicrobial susceptibility. \\nPersistent urethritis, cervicitis, or proctitis also might be caused \\nby other organisms (see Urethritis; Cervicitis; Proctitis).\\nA high prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae  infection has been \\nobserved among men and women previously treated for \\ngonorrhea (137,753,754,893). The majority of these infections \\nresult from reinfection caused by failure of sex partners to \\nreceive treatment or the initiation of sexual activity with a \\nnew infected partner, indicating a need for improved patient \\neducation and treatment of sex partners. Men or women who \\nhave been treated for gonorrhea should be retested 3 months \\nafter treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex \\npartners were treated; scheduling the follow-up visit at the \\ntime of treatment is encouraged. If retesting at 3 months is not \\npossible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek \\nmedical care <12 months after initial treatment.\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nRecent sex partners (i.e., persons having sexual contact with \\nthe infected patient <60 days preceding onset of symptoms or \\ngonorrhea diagnosis) should be referred for evaluation, testing, \\nand presumptive treatment. If the patient’s last potential sexual \\nexposure was >60 days before onset of symptoms or diagnosis, \\nthe most recent sex partner should be treated.\\nIf health department partner-management strategies (e.g., \\ndisease intervention specialists) are impractical or unavailable \\nfor persons with gonorrhea and partners’ access to prompt \\nclinical evaluation and treatment is limited, EPT can be \\ndelivered to the partner by the patient or a collaborating \\npharmacy as permitted by law (see Partner Services). T reatment \\nof the sexual partner with cefixime 800 mg as a single dose \\nis recommended, provided that concurrent chlamydial \\ninfection has been excluded. If a chlamydia test result has not \\nbeen documented, the partner may be treated with a single \\ndose of oral cefixime 800 mg plus oral doxycycline 100 mg \\n2 times/day for 7 days. If adherence with multiday dosing is \\na considerable concern, azithromycin 1 g can be considered \\nbut has lower treatment efficacy among persons with rectal \\nchlamydia (see Chlamydial Infections). Provision of medication \\nby EPT should be accompanied by written materials (125,127) \\nfor educating partners about gonorrhea, their exposure to \\ngonorrhea, and the importance of therapy. These materials \\nshould also educate partners about seeking clinical evaluation \\nfor adverse reactions or complications and general follow-up \\nwhen able. Educational materials for female partners should \\ninclude information about the importance of seeking medical \\nevaluation for PID, especially if symptomatic; undertreatment \\nof PID among female partners and missed opportunities for \\ndiagnosing other STIs among women are of concern. MSM \\nwith gonorrhea have a high risk for coexisting infections \\n(especially undiagnosed HIV) among their partners, and they \\nmight have partners without HIV who could benefit from \\nPrEP . Data are also limited regarding the effectiveness of EPT \\nin reducing persistent or recurrent gonorrhea among MSM \\n(133,135); thus, shared clinical decision-making regarding \\nEPT for MSM is recommended (see Partner Services). T o avoid \\nreinfection, sex partners should be instructed to abstain from \\ncondomless sexual intercourse for 7 days after they and their \\nsex partners have completed treatment and after resolution of \\nsymptoms, if present.\\nSuspected Cephalosporin Treatment Failure\\nCephalosporin treatment failure is the persistence of \\nN. gonorrhoeae infection despite recommended cephalosporin \\ntreatment; such failure is indicative of infection with \\ncephalosporin-resistant gonorrhea among persons whose \\npartners were treated and whose risk for reinfection is \\nlow. Suspected treatment failure has been reported among \\npersons receiving oral and injectable cephalosporins (852–\\n855,857,859,861,863,864,867,875,894). T reatment failure \\nshould be considered for persons whose symptoms do not \\nresolve within 3–5 days after recommended treatment and \\nreport no sexual contact during the posttreatment follow-up \\nperiod and persons with a positive test of cure (i.e., positive \\nculture >72 hours or positive NAAT >7 days after receiving \\nrecommended treatment) when no sexual contact is reported \\nduring the posttreatment follow-up period (874). T reatment \\nfailure should also be considered for persons who have a \\npositive culture on test of cure, if obtained, if evidence exists \\nof decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins on antimicrobial \\nsusceptibility testing, regardless of whether sexual contact is \\nreported during the posttreatment follow-up period.'),\n",

The USPSTF recommends ocular prophylaxis \\nwith erythromycin ointment for all newborns <24 hours \\nafter birth (903). In addition to continuing routine ocular \\nprophylaxis, prevention should focus on prenatal screening \\nfor N. gonorrhoeae, including\\n• screening pregnant women at risk (e.g., women aged \\n<25 years and those aged ≥25 years who have a new sex \\npartner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with \\nconcurrent partners, a sex partner who has an STI, or live \\nin a community with high rates of gonorrhea) for \\nN. gonorrhoeae infection at the first prenatal visit;\\n• treating all pregnant women with N. gonorrhoeae infection \\nduring pregnancy and retesting in 3 months, in the third \\ntrimester or at time of delivery (sex partners should be \\ntested and treated);\\n• retesting pregnant women in the third trimester who \\ninitially tested negative but remained at increased risk for \\nacquiring infection (e.g., women aged <25 years and those \\naged ≥25 years who have a new sex partner, more than one \\nsex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, a sex \\npartner who has an STI, or live in a community with high \\nrates of gonorrhea); and\\n• screening for gonorrhea at delivery for women not tested \\nduring pregnancy and at risk for infection (e.g., women \\naged <25 years and those aged ≥25 years who have a new \\nsex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with \\nconcurrent partners, a sex partner who has an STI, or live \\nin a community with high rates of gonorrhea) or received \\nno prenatal care; providers caring for the mother and the \\nnewborn should communicate to ensure follow-up on the \\nresults of laboratory tests performed at delivery, and if \\npositive, prompt appropriate treatment of the newborn \\nand mother.\\nErythromycin is the only ophthalmic ointment recommended \\nfor use among neonates. Silver nitrate and tetracycline \\nophthalmic ointments are no longer manufactured in the \\nUnited States, bacitracin is ineffective, and povidone iodine \\nhas not been studied adequately (905,906).

NAAT can be used to test for N. gonorrhoeae from \\nvaginal and urine specimens from girls and urine for boys (see \\nSexual Assault or Abuse of Children). Although data regarding \\nNAAT from extragenital sites (rectum and pharynx) among \\nchildren are more limited, and performance is test dependent, \\nno evidence supports that performance of NAAT for detection \\nof N. gonorrhoeae among children differs from that among adults \\n(553). Because of the implications of a N. gonorrhoeae diagnosis \\nin a child, only validated FDA-cleared NAAT assays should be \\nused with extragenital specimens. Consultation with an expert \\nis necessary before using NAAT to minimize the possibility of \\ncross-reaction with nongonococcal Neisseria species and other \\ncommensals (e.g., N. meningitidis , Neisseria sicca , Neisseria \\nlactamica, Neisseria cinerea, or M. catarrhalis) and to ensure \\ncorrect interpretation of results.\\nGram stains are inadequate for evaluating prepubertal children \\nfor gonorrhea and should not be used to diagnose or exclude \\ngonorrhea. If evidence of DGI exists, gonorrhea culture and \\nantimicrobial susceptibility testing should be obtained from \\nrelevant clinical sites (see Disseminated Gonococcal Infection).\\nRecommended Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonococcal \\nVulvovaginitis, Cervicitis, Urethritis, Pharyngitis, or Proctitis \\nAmong Infants and Children Weighing ≤45 kg\\nCeftriaxone 25–50 mg/kg body weight IV or IM in a single dose, not to \\nexceed 250 mg IM\\nRecommended Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonococcal \\nVulvovaginitis, Cervicitis, Urethritis, Pharyngitis, or Proctitis \\nAmong Children Weighing >45 kg\\nTreat with the regimen recommended for adults  \\n(see Gonococcal Infections)\\nRecommended Regimen for Bacteremia or Arthritis Among \\nChildren Weighing ≤45 kg \\nCeftriaxone 50 mg/kg body weight (maximum dose: 2 g) IM or IV in a \\nsingle dose daily every 24 hours for 7 days\\nRecommended Regimen for Bacteremia or Arthritis Among \\nChildren Weighing >45 kg \\nCeftriaxone 1 g IM or IV in a single dose daily every 24 hours for 7 days\\nOther Management Considerations\\nFollow-up cultures are unnecessary. Only parenteral \\ncephalosporins (i.e., ceftriaxone) are recommended for use \\namong children. All children identified as having gonococcal \\ninfections should be tested for C. trachomatis, syphilis, and \\nHIV (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children).\\nMycoplasma genitalium\\nM. genitalium causes symptomatic and asymptomatic \\nurethritis among men and is the etiology of approximately \\n15%–20% of NGU, 20%–25% of nonchlamydial NGU, \\nand 40% of persistent or recurrent urethritis (697,909,910). \\nInfection with C. trachomatis is common in selected geographic \\nareas ( 911–913), although M. genitalium  is often the sole \\npathogen. Data are insufficient to implicate M. genitalium \\ninfection with chronic complications among men (e.g., \\nepididymitis, prostatitis, or infertility). The consequences \\nof asymptomatic infection with M. genitalium among men \\nare unknown.\\nAmong women, M. genitalium  has been associated with \\ncervicitis, PID, preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, and \\ninfertility, with an approximately twofold increase in the risk \\nfor these outcomes among women infected with M. genitalium \\n(766). M. genitalium infections among women are also \\nfrequently asymptomatic, and the consequences associated \\nwith asymptomatic M. genitalium infection are unknown.\\nM. genitalium can be detected among 10%–30% of women \\nwith clinical cervicitis ( 767,770,772,914–916). The existing \\nevidence between M. genitalium  and cervicitis is mostly \\nsupportive of a causal association.

Prevalence of M. genitalium among women with \\nPID ranges from 4% to 22% (925,926) and was reported \\nas 60% in one study of women with postabortal PID ( 918). \\nThe association with PID is supported by early studies among \\nnonhuman primates that determined that endosalpingitis \\ndevelops after inoculation with M. genitalium (927). Recent \\nstudies evaluating the lower and upper genital tract using \\nhighly sensitive M. genitalium  NAAT assays or the role of \\nM. genitalium  in histologically defined endometritis have \\nreported significantly elevated risk for PID (928). However, \\nmost studies of M. genitalium  and PID, even those that \\ncontrolled extensively for other infections and behavioral and \\nbiologic risk, are cross-sectional. The few prospective studies \\nthat have evaluated the role of M. genitalium in establishing \\nsubsequent PID demonstrated increased PID risk; however, \\nthese were not statistically significant associations, often \\nbecause of a lack of statistical power. No clinical trial data are \\navailable that demonstrate that treating M. genitalium cervical \\ninfection prevents development of PID or endometritis. \\nAlthough data regarding the benefits of testing women with \\nPID for M. genitalium  and the importance of directing \\ntreatment against this organism are limited, the associations of \\nM. genitalium with cervicitis and PID in cross-sectional studies \\nusing NAAT testing are consistent (928).\\nData from case-control serologic studies ( 929 –931 ) \\nand a meta-analysis of clinical studies ( 766) indicate a \\npotential role in causing infertility. However, seroassays are \\nsuboptimal and inconclusive. Similarly, evidence for a role for \\nM. genitalium infection during pregnancy as a cause of perinatal \\ncomplications, including preterm delivery, spontaneous \\nabortion, or low birthweight, are conflicting because evidence is \\ninsufficient to attribute cause (766,932–934). Data are limited \\nregarding ectopic pregnancy and neonatal M. genitalium  \\ninfection (935,936).\\nRectal infection with M. genitalium has been reported among \\n1%–26% of MSM ( 937–940) and among 3% of women \\n(941). Rectal infections often are asymptomatic, although \\nhigher prevalence of M. genitalium has been reported among \\nmen with rectal symptoms. Similarly, although asymptomatic \\nM. genitalium has been detected in the pharynx, no evidence \\nexists of it causing oropharyngeal symptoms or systemic disease.\\nUrogenital M. genitalium infection is associated with HIV \\namong both men and women ( 942–944); however, the data \\nare from case-control and cross-sectional studies. Risk for HIV \\ninfection is increased among women with M. genitalium, and \\nevidence indicates that HIV shedding occurs more often among \\npersons with M. genitalium and HIV infection who are not taking \\nART than among persons without M. genitalium (942,944).\\nAntimicrobial Resistance\\nResistance to azithromycin has been rapidly increasing \\nand has been confirmed in multiple studies. Prevalence of \\nmolecular markers for macrolide resistance, which highly \\ncorrelates with treatment failure, ranges from 44% to 90% \\nin the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Australia \\n(697,702,945–953). T reatment with azithromycin alone \\nhas been reported to select for resistance ( 705,954,955), \\nwith treatment of macrolide-susceptible infections with a \\n1-g dose of azithromycin resulting in selection of resistant-\\nstrain populations in 10%–12% of cases. The prevalence of \\nquinolone resistance markers is much lower (697,956–959). \\nThe first clinical treatment failures after moxifloxacin were \\nassociated specifically with the S83I mutation in the parC gene \\n(954,960). Prevalence of the S83I mutation in the United \\nStates ranges from 0% to 15% ( 947); however, correlation \\nwith fluoroquinolone treatment failure is less consistent than \\nthat with mutations associated with macrolide resistance \\n(953,961,962). Clinically relevant quinolone resistance often \\nis associated with coexistent macrolide resistance (954).\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nM. genitalium is an extremely slow-growing organism. Culture \\ncan take up to 6 months, and technical laboratory capacity is \\nlimited to research settings.

Initial empiric therapy for PID, which \\nincludes doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days, \\nshould be provided at the time of presentation for care.

Cervicitis can also cause an abnormal \\nvaginal discharge. Although VVC is usually not sexually \\ntransmitted, it is included in this section because it is frequently \\ndiagnosed among women who have vaginal symptoms or are \\nbeing evaluated for an STI.\\nMultiple diagnostic methods are available for identifying the \\netiology of vaginal symptoms. Clinical laboratory testing can \\nidentify the vaginitis cause in the majority of women and is \\ndiscussed in detail in the sections of this report dedicated to \\neach condition. In the clinician’s office, the cause of vaginal \\nsymptoms can often be determined by pH, a potassium \\nhydroxide (KOH) test, and microscopic examination of a wet \\nmount of fresh samples of vaginal discharge. The pH of the \\nvaginal secretions can be measured by pH paper; an elevated \\npH (i.e., >4.5) is common with BV or trichomoniasis (although \\ntrichomoniasis can also be present with a normal vaginal pH). \\nBecause pH testing is not highly specific, vaginal discharge \\nshould be further examined microscopically by first diluting \\none sample in 1 or 2 drops of 0.9% normal saline solution on \\none slide and a second sample in 10% KOH solution (samples \\nthat emit an amine odor immediately upon application of \\nKOH suggest BV or trichomoniasis). Coverslips are then \\nplaced on the slides, and they are examined under a microscope \\nat low and high power. The saline-solution specimen might \\ndisplay motile trichomonads or clue cells (i.e., epithelial cells \\nwith borders obscured by small anaerobic bacteria), which \\nare characteristic of BV . The KOH specimen typically is used \\nto identify hyphae or blastospores observed with candidiasis. \\nHowever, absence of trichomonads in saline or fungal elements \\nin KOH samples does not rule out these infections because the \\nsensitivity of microscopy is approximately 50% compared with \\nNAAT (trichomoniasis) or culture (yeast) (670). Presence of \\nWBCs without evidence of trichomonads or yeast might also \\nindicate cervicitis (see Cervicitis).\\nIn settings where pH paper, KOH, and microscopy \\nare unavailable, a broad range of clinical laboratory tests, \\ndescribed in the diagnosis section for each disease, can be \\nused. Presence of objective signs of vulvovaginal inflammation \\nin the absence of vaginal pathogens after laboratory testing \\nindicates the possibility of mechanical, chemical, allergic, or \\nother noninfectious causes of vulvovaginal signs or symptoms. \\nFor women with persistent symptoms and no clear etiology, \\nreferral to a specialist should be considered.\\nBacterial Vaginosis\\nBV is a vaginal dysbiosis resulting from replacement of normal \\nhydrogen peroxide and lactic-acid–producing Lactobacillus \\nspecies in the vagina with high concentrations of anaerobic \\nbacteria, including G. vaginalis, Prevotella species, Mobiluncus \\nspecies, A. vaginae, and other BV-associated bacteria. A notable \\nfeature is the appearance of a polymicrobial biofilm on vaginal \\nepithelial cells (970). Certain women experience transient \\nvaginal microbial changes, whereas others experience them for \\nlonger intervals (971). BV is a highly prevalent condition and \\nthe most common cause of vaginal discharge worldwide (972). \\nHowever, in a nationally representative survey, the majority of \\nwomen with BV were asymptomatic (310).\\nBV is associated with having multiple male sex partners, \\nfemale partners, sexual relationships with more than one person \\n(973), a new sex partner, lack of condom use (974), douching \\n(975,976), and HSV-2 seropositivity (977). Male circumcision \\nreduces the risk for BV among women (978). In addition, BV \\nprevalence increases during menses (979,980). Women who \\nhave never been sexually active are rarely affected (981). The \\ncause of the microbial alteration that precipitates BV is not \\nfully understood, and whether BV results from acquisition \\nof a single sexually transmitted pathogen is unknown. BV \\nprevalence has been reported to increase among women with \\ncopper-containing IUDs (972,982). Hormonal contraception \\ndoes not increase risk for BV (983) and might protect against \\nBV development (983,984 ). Vitamin D deficiency has not \\nbeen reported to be a risk factor for BV (985).\\nWomen with BV are at increased risk for STI acquisition, \\nsuch as HIV , N. gonorrhoeae , C. trachomatis , T . vaginalis \\n(977), M. genitalium (986), HPV (987), and HSV-2 (988); \\ncomplications after gynecologic surgery; complications of \\npregnancy; and recurrence of BV (971,989–991). BV also \\nincreases HIV infection acquisition ( 992) because specific \\nBV-associated bacteria can increase susceptibility to HIV \\n(993, 994) and the risk for HIV transmission to male \\nsex partners ( 187). Evaluation of short-term valacyclovir \\nsuppression among women with HSV-2 did not decrease the \\nrisk for BV , despite effective suppression of HSV-2 (995).\\nAlthough BV-associated bacteria can be identified on male \\ngenitalia (996,997), treatment of male sex partners has not been \\nbeneficial in preventing the recurrence of BV ( 998). Among \\nWSW , a high level of BV concordance occurs between sex \\npartners (292); however, no studies have evaluated treatment \\nof female sex partners of WSW to prevent BV recurrence.'),\n",

Vaginal \\nGram stain, considered the reference standard laboratory \\nmethod for diagnosing BV , is used to determine the relative \\nconcentration of lactobacilli (i.e., long gram-positive rods), \\nsmall gram-negative and gram-variable rods (i.e., G. vaginalis or \\nBacteroides), and curved gram-negative rods (i.e., Mobiluncus) \\ncharacteristic of BV . A Nugent score of 0–3 is consistent with \\na Lactobacillus -predominant vaginal microbiota, 4–6 with \\nintermediate microbiota (emergence of G. vaginalis), and 7–10 \\nwith BV . Clinical diagnosis of BV by Amsel criteria requires at \\nleast three of the following four symptoms or signs:\\n• Homogeneous, thin discharge (milklike consistency) that \\nsmoothly coats the vaginal walls\\n• Clue cells (e.g., vaginal epithelial cells studded with \\nadherent bacteria) on microscopic examination\\n• pH of vaginal fluid >4.5\\n• A fishy odor of vaginal discharge before or after addition \\nof 10% KOH (i.e., the whiff test)\\nDetection of at least three Amsel criteria has been correlated \\nwith results by Gram stain (1001). The sensitivity and \\nspecificity of the Amsel criteria are 37%–70% and 94%–99%, \\nrespectively, compared with the Nugent score (1002).\\nIn addition to the Amsel criteria, multiple POC tests are \\navailable for BV diagnosis. The Osom BV Blue test (Sekisui \\nDiagnostics) detects vaginal sialidase activity (1003,1004). \\nThe Affirm VP III (Becton Dickinson) is an oligonucleotide \\nprobe test that detects high concentrations of G. vaginalis  \\nnucleic acids (>5 x 10 5 CFU of G. vaginalis/mL of vaginal \\nfluid) for diagnosing BV , Candida species, and T . vaginalis. \\nThis test has been reported to be most useful for symptomatic \\nwomen in conjunction with vaginal pH measurement and \\npresence of amine odor (sensitivity of 97%); specificity is \\n81% compared with Nugent. Finally, the FemExam T est \\nCard (Cooper Surgical) measures vaginal pH, presence of \\ntrimethylamine (a metabolic by-product of G. vaginalis ), \\nand proline aminopeptidase (1005). Sensitivity is 91% and \\nspecificity is 61%, compared with Nugent. This test has \\nprimarily been studied in resource-poor settings (1005), and \\nalthough it has been reported to be beneficial compared with \\nsyndromic management, it is not a preferred diagnostic method \\nfor BV diagnosis.\\nMultiple BV NAATs are available for BV diagnosis among \\nsymptomatic women (1002). These tests are based on detection \\nof specific bacterial nucleic acids and have high sensitivity \\nand specificity for BV (i.e., G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, BVAB2, \\nor Megasphaera type 1) ( 1006) and certain lactobacilli (i.e., \\nLactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, and Lactobacillus \\ngasseri). They can be performed on either clinician- or self-\\ncollected vaginal specimens with results available in <24 hours, \\ndepending on the availability of the molecular diagnostic \\nplatform (1002). Five quantitative multiplex PCR assays are \\navailable: Max Vaginal Panel (Becton Dickinson) (1007), \\nAptima BV (Hologic), NuSwab VG (LabCorp) ( 1008), \\nOneSwab BV Panel PCR with Lactobacillus Profiling by qPCR \\n(Medical Diagnostic Laboratories) (1009), and SureSwab BV \\n(Quest Diagnostics). T wo of these assays are FDA cleared (BD \\nMax Vaginal Panel and Aptima BV), and the other three are \\nlaboratory-developed tests.\\nThe Max Vaginal Panel provides results by an algorithmic \\nanalysis of molecular DNA detection of Lactobacillus species \\n(L. crispatus  and L. jensenii ) in addition to G. vaginalis , \\nA. vaginae , BVAB2, and Megasphaera type 1. This test has \\n90.5% sensitivity and 85.8% specificity for BV diagnosis, \\ncompared with Amsel criteria and Nugent score. It also provides \\nresults for Candida species and T . vaginalis. The Aptima BV \\ndetects G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, and certain Lactobacillus species \\nincluding L. crispatus, L. jensenii, and L. gasseri, with sensitivity \\nand specificity ranging from 95.0% to 97.3% and 85.8% to \\n89.6%, respectively (using either clinician- or patient-collected \\nvaginal swabs). The three laboratory-developed tests (NuSwab \\nVG, OneSwab BV Panel PCR with Lactobacillus Profiling by \\nqPCR, and SureSwab BV) have to be internally validated before \\nuse for patient care yet have good sensitivity and specificity, \\nsimilar to FDA-cleared assays. BV NAATs should be used \\namong symptomatic women only (e.g., women with vaginal \\ndischarge, odor, or itch) because their accuracy is not well \\ndefined for asymptomatic women. Despite the availability of \\nBV NAATs, traditional methods of BV diagnosis, including \\nthe Amsel criteria, Nugent score, and the Affirm VP III assay, \\nremain useful for diagnosing symptomatic BV because of their \\nlower cost and ability to provide a rapid diagnosis.

High-dose Vitamin D supplementation has not been \\ndetermined to decrease BV recurrence in randomized controlled \\ntrials (1033) and is not recommended.\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nData from earlier clinical trials indicate that a woman’s \\nresponse to therapy and the likelihood of relapse or recurrence \\nare not affected by treatment of her sex partner (998). Therefore, \\nroutine treatment of sex partners is not recommended. \\nHowever, a pilot study reported that male partner treatment \\n(i.e., metronidazole 400 mg orally 2 times/day in conjunction \\nwith 2% clindamycin cream applied topically to the penile \\nskin 2 times/day for 7 days) of women with recurrent BV \\nhad an immediate and sustained effect on the composition of \\nthe vaginal microbiota, with an overall decrease in bacterial \\ndiversity at day 28 (1034). Male partner treatment also had an \\nimmediate effect on the composition of the penile microbiota; \\nhowever, this was not as pronounced at day 28, compared \\nwith that among women. A phase 3 multicenter randomized \\ndouble-blinded trial evaluating the efficacy of a 7-day oral \\nmetronidazole regimen versus placebo for treatment of male \\nsex partners of women with recurrent BV did not find that \\nmale partner treatment reduced BV recurrence in female \\npartners, although women whose male partners adhered \\nto multidose metronidazole were less likely to experience \\ntreatment failure (1035).\\nSpecial Considerations\\nDrug Allergy, Intolerance, or Adverse Reactions\\nIntravaginal clindamycin cream is preferred in case of allergy \\nor intolerance to metronidazole or tinidazole. Intravaginal \\nmetronidazole gel can be considered for women who are not \\nallergic to metronidazole but do not tolerate oral metronidazole.\\nPregnancy\\nBV treatment is recommended for all symptomatic pregnant \\nwomen because symptomatic BV has been associated with \\nadverse pregnancy outcomes, including premature rupture \\nof membranes, preterm birth, intra-amniotic infection, and \\npostpartum endometritis (989,991,1036). Studies have been \\nundertaken to determine the efficacy of BV treatment among \\nthis population, including two trials demonstrating that oral \\nmetronidazole was efficacious during pregnancy by using \\nthe 250 mg 3 times/day regimen (1037,1038); however, oral \\nmetronidazole administered as a 500 mg 2 times/day regimen \\ncan also be used. One trial involving a limited number of \\nparticipants revealed treatment with oral metronidazole \\n500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days to be equally effective as \\nmetronidazole gel 0.75% for 5 days, with cure rates of 70% \\nby using Amsel criteria to define cure (1039). Another trial \\ndemonstrated a cure rate of 85% by using Gram-stain criteria \\nafter treatment with oral clindamycin 300 mg 2 times/day for \\n7 days (1040–1043).\\nAlthough older studies indicated a possible link between \\nusing vaginal clindamycin during pregnancy and adverse \\noutcomes for the newborn, newer data demonstrate that \\nthis treatment approach is safe for pregnant women (1044). \\nAlthough metronidazole crosses the placenta, no evidence of \\nteratogenicity or mutagenic effects among infants has been \\nreported in multiple cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort \\nstudies of pregnant women (1041–1043). These data indicate \\nthat metronidazole therapy poses low risk during pregnancy. \\nData from human studies are limited regarding the use of \\ntinidazole in pregnancy; however, animal data demonstrate \\nthat such therapy poses moderate risk. Thus, tinidazole should \\nbe avoided during pregnancy (431). Data are insufficient \\nregarding efficacy and adverse effects of secnidazole, Clindesse \\n2% vaginal cream, metronidazole 1.3% vaginal gel, and \\n750-mg vaginal metronidazole tablets during pregnancy; thus, \\ntheir use should be avoided.\\nOral therapy has not been reported to be superior to topical \\ntherapy for treating symptomatic BV in effecting cure or \\npreventing adverse outcomes of pregnancy.

Seven \\ntrials have evaluated treatment of pregnant women with \\nasymptomatic BV at high risk for preterm delivery: one revealed \\nharm (1045), two reported no benefit (1046,1047), and four \\ndemonstrated benefit (1037,1038,1048,1049).\\nT reatment of asymptomatic BV among pregnant women \\nat low risk for preterm delivery has not been reported to \\nreduce adverse outcomes of pregnancy in a large multicenter \\nrandomized controlled trial (1050 ). Therefore, routine \\nscreening for BV among asymptomatic pregnant women at \\nhigh or low risk for preterm delivery for preventing preterm \\nbirth is not recommended.\\nMetronidazole is secreted in breast milk. With maternal \\noral therapy, breastfed infants receive metronidazole in doses \\nthat are less than those used to treat infections among infants, \\nalthough the active metabolite adds to the total infant exposure. \\nPlasma levels of the drug and metabolite are measurable but \\nremain less than maternal plasma levels (https://www.ncbi.\\nnlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501922/?report=classic ).

Women with HIV infection \\nand BV should receive the same treatment regimen as those \\nwho do not have HIV .\\nTrichomoniasis\\nT richomoniasis is estimated to be the most prevalent nonviral \\nSTI worldwide, affecting approximately 3.7 million persons \\nin the United States (838,1055). Because trichomoniasis is \\nnot a reportable disease (1056), and no recommendations are \\navailable for general screening for T . vaginalis, the epidemiology \\nof trichomoniasis has largely come from population-based and \\nclinic-based surveillance studies. The U.S. population-based \\nT . vaginalis prevalence is 2.1% among females and 0.5% among \\nmales, with the highest rates among Black females (9.6%) \\nand Black males (3.6%), compared with non-Hispanic White \\nwomen (0.8%) and Hispanic women (1.4%) (1057,1058). \\nUnlike chlamydia and gonorrhea, T . vaginalis prevalence \\nrates are as high among women aged >24 years as they are \\nfor women aged <24 years (1057). Among persons attending \\nnine geographically diverse STD clinics, the trichomonas \\nprevalence was 14.6% among women (1059), and a study \\nof STD clinic attendees in Birmingham, Alabama, identified \\na prevalence of 27% among women and 9.8% among men \\n(1060). Symptomatic women have a four times higher rate of \\ninfection than asymptomatic women (26% versus 6.5%) (1061). \\nRates are also high among incarcerated persons of both sexes at \\n9%–32% of incarcerated women (386,387,391,392,1062) and \\n3.2%–8% of incarcerated men (388). Women with a history of \\nincarceration are two to five times more likely to have T . vaginalis \\n(387,388,1063,1064). Other risk factors for T . vaginalis include \\nhaving two or more sex partners during the previous year, having \\nless than a high school education, and living below the national\\n \\npoverty level (1065). Women with BV are at higher risk for \\nT . v\\naginalis (1066). Male partners of women with trichomoniasis \\nare likely to have infection (1067), although the prevalence of \\ntrichomoniasis among MSM is low (179,1068).\\nThe majority of persons who have trichomoniasis \\n(70%–85%) either have minimal or no genital symptoms, \\nand untreated infections might last from months to years \\n(137,1069,1070). Men with trichomoniasis sometimes have \\nsymptoms of urethritis, epididymitis, or prostatitis, and women \\nwith trichomoniasis sometimes have vaginal discharge, which \\ncan be diffuse, malodorous, or yellow-green with or without \\nvulvar irritation, and might have a strawberry-appearing cervix, \\nwhich is observed more often on colposcopy than on physical \\nexamination (1071). Although many persons might be unaware \\nof their infection, it is readily passed between sex partners \\nduring penile-vaginal sex (1072) or through transmission of \\ninfected vaginal fluids or fomites among women who have sex \\nwith women (275,294).\\nAmong persons who are sexually active, the best way to \\nprevent genital trichomoniasis is through consistent and correct \\nuse of condoms (external or internal) (18). Partners of men \\nwho have been circumcised might have a somewhat reduced \\nrisk for T . vaginalis infection (1072,1073). Douching is not \\nrecommended because it might increase the risk for vaginal \\ninfections, including trichomoniasis (1074).\\nT . vaginalis causes reproductive morbidity and has been \\nreported to be associated with a 1.4-times greater likelihood \\nof preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, and \\ninfants who are small for gestational age (1075). T . vaginalis \\nwas also determined to be associated with a 2.1-fold increased \\nrisk for cervical cancer in a meta-analysis (1076).

Among \\nwomen with HIV infection, T . vaginalis infection is associated \\nwith increased risk for PID (1080–1082).\\nDiagnostic testing for T . vaginalis should be performed for \\nwomen seeking care for vaginal discharge. Annual screening \\nmight be considered for persons receiving care in high-\\nprevalence settings (e.g., STD clinics and correctional facilities) \\nand for asymptomatic women at high risk for infection (e.g., \\nmultiple sex partners, transactional sex, drug misuse, or a \\nhistory of STIs or incarceration). However, data are lacking \\nregarding whether screening and treatment for asymptomatic \\ntrichomoniasis in high-prevalence settings for women at high \\nrisk can reduce any adverse health events and health disparities \\nor reduce community infection burden. Decisions about \\nscreening can be guided by local epidemiology of T . vaginalis \\ninfection. Routine annual screening for T . vaginalis among \\nasymptomatic women with HIV infection is recommended \\nbecause of these adverse events associated with trichomoniasis \\nand HIV infection.\\nExtragenital T . vaginalis is possible but highly uncommon \\ncompared with genital infections. A study of 500 men in San \\nFrancisco, California, reported a 0.6% rate of rectal T . vaginalis \\n(1083); however, this might reflect deposition of T . vaginalis \\nDNA and not necessarily active infection.

T o improve detection, clinicians using \\nwet mounts should attempt to evaluate slides immediately \\nafter specimen collection because sensitivity decreases quickly \\nto 20% within 1 hour after collection (1087). More highly \\nsensitive and specific molecular diagnostic options are available, \\nwhich should be used in conjunction with a negative wet \\nmount when possible.\\nNAATs are highly sensitive, detecting more T . vaginalis \\ninfections than wet-mount microscopy among women \\n(1060). The Aptima T . vaginalis assay (Beckton Dickinson) is \\nFDA cleared for detection of T . vaginalis from symptomatic \\nor asymptomatic women. Reliable samples include \\nclinician-collected endocervical swabs, clinician-collected \\nvaginal swabs, female urine specimens, and liquid Pap \\nsmear specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution (Hologic) \\n(698,1088 ). This assay detects RNA by transcription-\\nmediated amplification with a sensitivity of 95.3%–100% \\nand specificity of 95.2%–100%, compared with wet mount \\nand culture (1088,1089). Among women, vaginal swabs and \\nurine specimens have <100% concordance (1084). This assay \\nhas not been FDA cleared for use among men and should be \\ninternally validated in accordance with CLIA regulations before \\nuse with urine or urethral swabs from men. The Probe T ec TV \\nQx Amplified DNA Assay (Becton Dickinson) is FDA cleared \\nfor detection of T . vaginalis from vaginal (patient-collected \\nor clinician-collected) swabs, endocervical swabs, or urine \\nspecimens from women and has sensitivity of 98.3% and \\nspecificity of 99.6%, compared with wet mount and culture \\n(1090). Similar to the Aptima T . vaginalis assay, this test is only \\nFDA cleared for use among women and should be internally \\nvalidated for use with men. The Max CTGCTV2 assay (Becton \\nDickinson) is also FDA clear\\ned for detection of T . vaginalis in \\npatient-collected or clinician-collected vaginal swab specimens \\nand male and female urine specimens, with sensitivity and \\nspecificity of 96.2%–100% and 99.1%–100%, r\\nespectively, \\ndepending on the specimen type, compared with wet mount \\nand culture (1091). GeneXpert TV (Cepheid) is a moderately \\ncomplex rapid test that can be performed in ≤1 hour and can be \\nused at the POC (1092). It has been FDA cleared for use with \\nfemale urine specimens, endocervical swabs, patient-collected \\nor clinician-collected vaginal specimens, and male urine \\nspecimens, with sensitivity and specificity of 99.5%–100% \\nand 99.4%–99.9% (1007), respectively, compared with wet \\nmount and culture.\\nMultiple FDA-cleared rapid tests are available for detecting \\nT . vaginalis with improved sensitivities and specificities, \\ncompared with wet mount. The Osom trichomonas rapid \\ntest (Sekisui Diagnostics) is an antigen-detection test that uses \\nimmunochromatographic capillary flow dipstick technology \\nthat can be performed at the POC by using clinician-obtained \\nvaginal specimens.

For women, vaginal \\nsecretions are the preferred specimen type for culture because \\nurine culture is less sensitive (698,1099,1100). For men, \\nculture specimens require a urethral swab, urine sediment, \\nor semen. T o improve diagnostic yield, multiple specimens \\nfrom men can be used to inoculate a single culture.

In randomized \\nclinical trials, recommended metronidazole regimens have \\nresulted in cure rates of approximately 84%–98% (1108), \\nand the recommended tinidazole regimen has resulted in cure \\nrates of approximately 92%–100% (1108–1112). Randomized \\ncontrolled trials comparing single 2-g doses of metronidazole \\nand tinidazole indicated that tinidazole is equivalent or superior \\nto metronidazole in achieving parasitologic cure and symptom \\nresolution (1110,1113,1114).\\nMetronidazole gel does not reach therapeutic levels in the \\nurethra and perivaginal glands. Because it is less efficacious \\nthan oral metronidazole, it is not recommended.\\nOther Management Considerations\\nProviders should advise persons with T . vaginalis infections \\nto abstain from sex until they and their sex partners are treated \\n(i.e., when therapy has been completed and any symptoms \\nhave resolved). T esting for other STIs, including HIV , syphilis, \\ngonorrhea, and chlamydia, should be performed for persons \\nwith T . vaginalis.\\nFollow-Up\\nBecause of the high rate of reinfection among women treated \\nfor trichomoniasis, retesting for T . vaginalis is recommended \\nfor all sexually active women <3 months after initial treatment \\nregardless of whether they believe their sex partners were \\ntreated (137,1115). If retesting at 3 months is not possible, \\nclinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical \\ncare <12 months after initial treatment. Data are insufficient \\nto support retesting men after treatment.\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nConcurrent treatment of all sex partners is vital for \\npreventing reinfections.

If a man has persistent T . vaginalis after \\na single 2-g dose of metronidazole and has been reexposed \\nto an untreated partner, he should be retreated with a single \\n2-g dose of metronidazole. If he has not been reexposed, he \\nshould be administered a course of metronidazole 500 mg \\n2 times/day for 7 days.\\nFor persons who are experiencing persistent infection \\nnot attributable to reexposure, clinicians should request a \\nkit from CDC to perform drug-resistance testing (https://\\nwww.cdc.gov/laboratory/specimen-submission/detail.\\nhtml?CDCT estCode=CDC-10239). CDC is experienced with \\nsusceptibility testing for nitroimidazole-resistant T . vaginalis \\nand can provide guidance regarding treatment in cases of \\ndrug resistance. On the basis of drug resistance testing, an \\nalternative treatment regimen might be recommended. \\nT reatments for infections demonstrating in vitro resistance \\ncan include metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g daily for 7 days. \\nIf a patient has treatment failure after the 7-day regimen of \\nhigh-dose oral metronidazole or tinidazole, two additional \\ntreatment options have been determined to have successful \\nresults for women. The first is high-dose oral tinidazole \\n2 g daily plus intravaginal tinidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for \\n14 days (1121). If this regimen fails, high-dose oral tinidazole \\n(1 g 3 times/day) plus intravaginal paromomycin (4 g of 6.25% \\nintravaginal paromomycin cream nightly) for 14 days should \\nbe considered (1122).\\nAlternative regimens might be effective but have not been \\nsystemically evaluated; therefore, consultation with an infectious \\ndisease specialist is recommended. Clinical improvement has \\nbeen reported with intravaginal boric acid (1123,1124) but \\nnot with nitazoxanide (1123–1125). The following topically \\napplied agents have minimal success (<50%) and are not \\nrecommended: intravaginal betadine (povidone-iodine), \\nclotrimazole, acetic acid, furazolidone, GV , nonoxynol-9, and \\npotassium permanganate (1126). No other topical microbicide \\nhas been reported to be effective against trichomoniasis.\\nSpecial Considerations\\nDrug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions\\nMetronidazole and tinidazole are both nitroimidazoles. \\nPatients with an IgE-mediated-type hypersensitivity reaction \\nto 5-nitroimidazole antimicrobials should be managed by \\nmetronidazole desensitization according to published regimens \\n(1127,1128) and in consultation with an allergy specialist. The \\noptimal treatment for patients with T . vaginalis who are unable \\nto be desensitized has not been systematically investigated and is \\nbased on case reports, some of which report using paromomycin \\nor boric acid for treating T . vaginalis (1123,1129).\\nPregnancy\\nT . vaginalis infection among pregnant women is associated \\nwith adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly premature \\nrupture of membranes, preterm delivery, and delivery of infants \\nwho are small for gestational age ( 1075). One randomized \\ntrial of pregnant women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis \\nreported no substantial difference in preterm birth after \\ntreatment with 2 g of metronidazole 48 hours apart during \\n16–23 and 24–29 weeks’ gestation, compared with placebo \\n(1130). However, that trial had multiple limitations, including \\nuse of an atypical metronidazole regimen. Another multicenter \\nobservational study of asymptomatic pregnant women in sub-\\nSahara African, the majority with HIV infection, reported \\nneither trichomoniasis nor its treatment appeared to influence \\nthe risk for preterm birth or a low-birthweight infant (1131).'),\n",

T reatment of T . vaginalis infection \\ncan relieve symptoms of vaginal discharge for pregnant women \\nand reduce sexual transmission to partners. Although perinatal \\ntransmission of trichomoniasis is uncommon, treatment \\nmight also prevent respiratory or genital infection in the \\nnewborn (1136,1137). Clinicians should counsel symptomatic \\npregnant women with trichomoniasis about the potential \\nrisks and benefits of treatment and about the importance of \\npartner treatment and condom use in the prevention of sexual \\ntransmission. The benefit of routine screening for T . vaginalis \\nin asymptomatic pregnant women has not been established.\\nMetronidazole is secreted in breast milk. With maternal oral \\ntherapy, breastfed infants receive metronidazole in doses that \\nare lower than those used to treat infections among infants, \\nalthough the active metabolite adds to the total infant exposure. \\nPlasma levels of the drug and metabolite are measurable but \\nremain less than maternal plasma levels (https://www.ncbi.nlm.\\nnih.gov/books/NBK501922).

T . vaginalis infection among these women is \\nsubstantially associated with pelvic inflammatory disease \\n(1082). Among women who are not virally suppressed, \\ntreatment of trichomoniasis is associated with decreases in \\ngenital tract HIV viral load and viral shedding (1079,1139); \\nhowever, no difference might occur among women who are \\nvirally suppressed (1140). Because of the high prevalence \\nof T . vaginalis among women with HIV and the potential \\nfor adverse reproductive health, poor birth outcomes, and \\npossibly amplified HIV transmission, routine screening and \\nprompt treatment are recommended for all women with HIV \\ninfection; screening should occur at entry to care and then at \\nleast annually thereafter.\\nA randomized clinical trial involving women with HIV \\nand T . vaginalis infection demonstrated that a single dose \\nof metronidazole 2 g orally was less effective than 500 mg \\n2 times/day for 7 days (1105). Factors that might interfere \\nwith standard single-dose treatment for trichomoniasis among \\nwomen with HIV include high rates of asymptomatic BV \\ninfection, ART use, changes in vaginal ecology, and impaired \\nimmunity (1141). Thus, to improve cure rates, women with \\nHIV who receive a diagnosis of T . vaginalis infection should \\nbe treated with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day \\nfor 7 days. For pregnant women with HIV , screening at \\nthe first prenatal visit and prompt treatment, as needed, are \\nrecommended because T . vaginalis infection is a risk factor for \\nvertical transmission of HIV (1142).\\nTreatment\\nT reatment reduces symptoms and signs of T . vaginalis \\ninfection, cures infection, and might reduce transmission. \\nLikelihood of adverse outcomes among women with HIV \\ninfection is also reduced with T . vaginalis therapy.\\nRecommended Regimen for Trichomonas and HIV Infection \\nAmong Women \\nMetronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days\\nIf a woman with HIV infection experiences treatment failure, the \\nprotocol outlined is recommended (see Recurrent T richomonas). \\nOther management considerations, follow-up, and management \\nof sex partners should be performed as for women without HIV \\ninfection.

Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, \\nand thick curdy vaginal discharge. Most healthy women with \\nuncomplicated VVC have no identifiable precipitating factors. \\nThe diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and \\nsymptoms of vaginitis when either a wet preparation (saline, \\n10% KOH) of vaginal discharge demonstrates budding \\nyeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae, or a culture or other test \\nyields a positive result for a yeast species. Candida vaginitis is \\nassociated with normal vaginal pH (<4.5). Use of 10% KOH \\nin wet preparations improves the visualization of yeast and \\nmycelia by disrupting cellular material that might obscure \\nthe yeast or pseudohyphae.

However, women with \\npersistent or recurrent symptoms after treatment should be \\ninstructed to return for follow-up visits.\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nUncomplicated VVC is not usually acquired through sexual \\nintercourse, and data do not support treatment of sex partners. \\nA minority of male sex partners have balanitis, characterized \\nby erythematous areas on the glans of the penis in conjunction \\nwith pruritus or irritation. These men benefit from treatment \\nwith topical antifungal agents to relieve symptoms.\\nSpecial Considerations\\nDrug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions\\nT opical agents usually cause no systemic side effects, although \\nlocal burning or irritation might occur. Oral azoles occasionally \\ncause nausea, abdominal pain, and headache. Therapy with the \\noral azoles has rarely been associated with abnormal elevations \\nof liver enzymes. Clinically important interactions can occur \\nwhen oral azoles are administered with other drugs (1141).\\nComplicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nVaginal culture or PCR should be obtained from women \\nwith complicated VVC to confirm clinical diagnosis and \\nidentify non–albicans Candida . Candida glabrata  does not \\nform pseudohyphae or hyphae and is not easily recognized \\non microscopy. C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more \\ncommon in vaginal isolates (1144,1145), and non– albicans \\nCandida is intrinsically resistant to azoles; therefore, culture \\nand susceptibility testing should be considered for patients \\nwho remain symptomatic.\\nRecurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis\\nRecurrent VVC, usually defined as three or more episodes \\nof symptomatic VVC in <1 year, affects <5% of women but \\ncarries a substantial economic burden (1146). Recurrent VVC \\ncan be either idiopathic or secondary (related to frequent \\nantibiotic use, diabetes, or other underlying host factors). The \\npathogenesis of recurrent VVC is poorly understood, and the \\nmajority of women with recurrent VVC have no apparent \\npredisposing or underlying conditions. C. glabrata and other \\nnon–albicans Candida  species are observed in 10%–20% \\nof women with recurrent VVC. Conventional antimycotic \\ntherapies are not as effective against these non–albicans yeasts \\nas against C. albicans.\\nTreatment\\nMost episodes of recurrent VVC caused by C. albicans  \\nrespond well to short-duration oral or topical azole therapy. \\nHowever, to maintain clinical and mycologic control, a longer \\nduration of initial therapy (e.g., 7–14 days of topical therapy \\nor a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg oral dose of fluconazole \\nevery third day for a total of 3 doses [days 1, 4, and 7]) \\nis recommended, to attempt mycologic remission, before \\ninitiating a maintenance antifungal regimen.\\nOral fluconazole (i.e., a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg dose) \\nweekly for 6 months is the indicated maintenance regimen. \\nIf this regimen is not feasible, topical treatments used \\nintermittently can also be considered. Suppressive maintenance \\ntherapies are effective at controlling recurrent VVC but are \\nrarely curative long-term (1147). Because C. albicans azole \\nresistance is becoming more common, susceptibility tests, if \\navailable, should be obtained among symptomatic patients who \\nremain culture positive despite maintenance therapy. These \\nwomen should be managed in consultation with a specialist.\\nSevere Vulvovaginal Candidiasis\\nSevere VVC (i.e., extensive vulvar erythema, edema, \\nexcoriation, and fissure formation) is associated with lower \\nclinical response rates among patients treated with short courses \\nof topical or oral therapy. Either 7–14 days of topical azole or \\n150 mg of fluconazole in two sequential oral doses (second dose \\n72 hours after initial dose) is recommended.\\nNon–albicans Vulvovaginal Candidiasis\\nBecause approximately 50% of women with a positive culture \\nfor non–albicans Candida might be minimally symptomatic or \\nhave no symptoms, and because successful treatment is often \\ndifficult, clinicians should make every effort to exclude other \\ncauses of vaginal symptoms for women with non–albicans \\nyeast (1148). The optimal treatment of non–albicans VVC \\nremains unknown; however, a longer duration of therapy \\n(7–14 days) with a nonfluconazole azole regimen (oral or \\ntopical) is recommended. If recurrence occurs, 600 mg of boric \\nacid in a gelatin capsule administered vaginally once daily for \\n3 weeks is indicated. This regimen has clinical and mycologic \\neradication rates of approximately 70% (1149). If symptoms \\nrecur, referral to a specialist is advised.'),\n",

Only topical \\nazole therapies, applied for 7 days, are recommended for use \\namong pregnant women. Epidemiologic studies indicate a \\nsingle 150-mg dose of fluconazole might be associated with \\nspontaneous abortion (1150) and congenital anomalies; \\ntherefore, it should not be used (1151).\\nHIV Infection\\nVaginal Candida colonization rates among women with \\nHIV infection are higher than among women without HIV \\nwith similar demographic and risk behavior characteristics, \\nand the colonization rates correlate with increasing severity of \\nimmunosuppression (1152). Symptomatic VVC is also more \\nfrequent among women with HIV infection and similarly \\ncorrelates with severity of immunodeficiency (1153). In \\naddition, among women with HIV , systemic azole exposure \\nis associated with isolation of non–albicans Candida species \\nfrom the vagina.\\nT reatment for uncomplicated and complicated VVC \\namong women with HIV infection should not differ from \\nthat for women who do not have HIV . Although long-\\nterm prophylactic therapy with fluconazole 200 mg weekly \\nhas been effective in reducing C. albicans colonization and \\nsymptomatic VVC (1154), this regimen is not recommended \\nfor women with HIV infection in the absence of complicated \\nVVC (98). Although VVC is associated with increased HIV \\nseroconversion among HIV-negative women and increased \\nHIV cervicovaginal levels among women with HIV infection, \\nthe effect of treatment for VVC on HIV acquisition and \\ntransmission remains unknown.\\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease\\nPID comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of \\nthe upper female genital tract, including any combination \\nof endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and pelvic \\nperitonitis (1155–1157). Sexually transmitted organisms, \\nespecially N. gonorrhoeae  and C. trachomatis , often are \\nimplicated. Recent studies report that the proportion of \\nPID cases attributable to N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis is \\ndecreasing; of women who received a diagnosis of acute PID, \\napproximately 50% have a positive test for either of those \\norganisms (1158–1160). Micro-organisms that comprise the \\nvaginal flora, such as strict and facultative anaerobes (1160) \\nand G. vaginalis, H. influenzae, enteric gram-negative rods, and \\nStreptococcus agalactiae, have been associated with PID (1161). \\nIn addition, cytomegalovirus (CMV), T . vaginalis, M. hominis, \\nand U. urealyticum might be associated with certain PID cases \\n(1072). Data also indicate that M. genitalium might have a role \\nin PID pathogenesis (765,928) and might be associated with \\nmilder symptoms (919,923,928), although one study failed \\nto demonstrate a substantial increase in PID after detection of \\nM. genitalium in the lower genital tract (925).\\nScreening and treating sexually active women for chlamydia \\nand gonorrhea reduces their risk for PID (1162,1163). Although \\nBV is associated with PID, whether PID incidence can be \\nreduced by identifying and treating women with BV is unclear \\n(1161). Whether screening young women for M. genitalium is \\nassociated with a reduction in PID is unknown.\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nAcute PID is difficult to diagnose because of the considerable \\nvariation in symptoms and signs associated with this condition. \\nWomen with PID often have subtle or nonspecific symptoms or \\nare asymptomatic. Delay in diagnosis and treatment probably \\ncontributes to inflammatory sequelae in the upper genital tract. \\nLaparoscopy can be used to obtain a more accurate diagnosis \\nof salpingitis and a more complete bacteriologic diagnosis. \\nHowever, this diagnostic tool frequently is not readily available, \\nand its use is not easily justifiable when symptoms are mild or \\nvague. Moreover, laparoscopy will not detect endometritis and \\nmight not detect subtle inflammation of the fallopian tubes. \\nConsequently, a PID diagnosis usually is based on imprecise \\nclinical findings (1164–1166).\\nData indicate that a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic PID \\nhas a positive predictive value for salpingitis of 65%–90%, \\ncompared with laparoscopy (1167–1170 ). The positive \\npredictive value of a clinical diagnosis of acute PID depends on \\nthe epidemiologic characteristics of the population, with higher \\npositive predictive values among sexually active young women \\n(particularly adolescents), women attending STD clinics, and'),\n",

Regardless of positive predictive value, no single \\nhistorical, physical, or laboratory finding is both sensitive \\nand specific for the diagnosis of acute PID. Combinations of \\ndiagnostic findings that improve either sensitivity (i.e., detect \\nmore women who have PID) or specificity (i.e., exclude more \\nwomen who do not have PID) do so only at the expense of the \\nother. For example, requiring two or more findings excludes \\nmore women who do not have PID and reduces the number \\nof women with PID who are identified.\\nEpisodes of PID often go unrecognized. Although certain \\ncases are asymptomatic, others are not diagnosed because \\nthe patient or the health care provider do not recognize the \\nimplications of mild or nonspecific symptoms or signs (e.g., \\nabnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, and vaginal discharge). Even \\nwomen with mild or asymptomatic PID might be at risk for \\ninfertility (1157). Because of the difficulty of diagnosis and \\nthe potential for damage to the reproductive health of women, \\nhealth care providers should maintain a low threshold for the \\nclinical diagnosis of PID (1158). The recommendations for \\ndiagnosing PID are intended to assist health care providers to \\nrecognize when PID should be suspected and when additional \\ninformation should be obtained to increase diagnostic certainty. \\nDiagnosis and management of other causes of lower abdominal \\npain (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, acute appendicitis, ovarian cyst, \\novarian torsion, or functional pain) are unlikely to be impaired \\nby initiating antimicrobial therapy for PID. Presumptive \\ntreatment for PID should be initiated for sexually active \\nyoung women and other women at risk for STIs if they are \\nexperiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for \\nthe illness other than PID can be identified, or if one or more \\nof the following three minimum clinical criteria are present \\non pelvic examination: cervical motion tenderness, uterine \\ntenderness, or adnexal tenderness.\\nMore specific criteria for diagnosing PID include endometrial \\nbiopsy with histopathologic evidence of endometritis; \\ntransvaginal sonography or magnetic resonance imaging \\ntechniques demonstrating thickened, fluid-filled tubes with or \\nwithout free pelvic fluid or tubo-ovarian complex, or Doppler \\nstudies indicating pelvic infection (e.g., tubal hyperemia); \\nand laparoscopic findings consistent with PID. A diagnostic \\nevaluation that includes some of these more extensive \\nprocedures might be warranted in certain cases. Endometrial \\nbiopsy is warranted for women undergoing laparoscopy who \\ndo not have visual evidence of salpingitis because endometritis \\nis the only sign of PID for certain women.\\nRequiring that all three minimum criteria be present \\nbefore the initiation of empiric treatment can result in \\ninsufficient sensitivity for a PID diagnosis. After deciding \\nwhether to initiate empiric treatment, clinicians should also \\nconsider the risk profile for STIs. More elaborate diagnostic \\nevaluation frequently is needed because incorrect diagnosis \\nand management of PID might cause unnecessary morbidity. \\nFor example, the presence of signs of lower genital tract \\ninflammation (predominance of leukocytes in vaginal \\nsecretions, cervical discharge, or cervical friability), in addition \\nto one of the three minimum criteria, increases the specificity of \\nthe diagnosis. One or more of the following additional criteria \\ncan be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum clinical \\ncriteria and support a PID diagnosis:\\n• Oral temperature >38.3°C (>101°F)\\n• Abnormal cervical mucopurulent discharge or cervical \\nfriability\\n• Presence of abundant numbers of WBCs on saline \\nmicroscopy of vaginal fluid\\n• Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate\\n• Elevated C-reactive protein\\n• Laboratory documentation of cervical infection with \\nN. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis\\nThe majority of women with PID have either mucopurulent \\ncervical discharge or evidence of WBCs on a microscopic \\nevaluation of a saline preparation of vaginal fluid (i.e., wet \\nprep). If the cervical discharge appears normal and no WBCs \\nare observed on the wet prep of vaginal fluid, a PID diagnosis \\nis unlikely, and alternative causes of pain should be considered. \\nA wet prep of vaginal fluid also can detect the presence of \\nconcomitant infections (e.g., BV or trichomoniasis).\\nTreatment\\nPID treatment regimens should provide empiric, broad-\\nspectrum coverage of likely pathogens. Multiple parenteral and \\noral antimicrobial regimens have been effective in achieving \\nclinical and microbiologic cure in randomized clinical trials \\nwith short-term follow-up (1171–1173). However, only \\na limited number of studies have assessed and compared \\nthese regimens with regard to infection elimination in the \\nendometrium and fallopian tubes or determined the incidence \\nof long-term complications (e.g., tubal infertility and ectopic \\npregnancy) after antimicrobial regimens (1159,1164,1174). \\nThe optimal treatment regimen and long-term outcome of \\nearly treatment of women with subclinical PID are unknown. \\nAll regimens used to treat PID should also be effective against \\nN. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis because negative endocervical \\nscreening for these organisms does not rule out upper genital \\ntract infection.

If no \\nclinical improvement has occurred <72 hours after outpatient \\nIM or oral therapy, then hospitalization, assessment of the \\nantimicrobial regimen, and additional diagnostics, including \\nconsideration of diagnostic laparoscopy for alternative \\ndiagnoses, are recommended. All women who have received a \\ndiagnosis of chlamydial or gonococcal PID should be retested \\n3 months after treatment, regardless of whether their sex \\npartners have been treated (753).

These women \\nshould be hospitalized and treated with IV antimicrobials in \\nconsultation with an infectious disease specialist.\\nHIV Infection\\nDifferences in PID clinical manifestations among women \\nwith HIV infection and those without have not been well \\ndelineated (1182). In early observational studies, women \\nwith HIV infection and PID were more likely to require \\nsurgical intervention. More comprehensive observational and \\ncontrolled studies have demonstrated that women with HIV \\ninfection and PID have similar symptoms, compared with \\nwomen without HIV (1183–1185), except they are more likely \\nto have a tubo-ovarian abscess. Women with HIV responded \\nequally well to recommended parenteral and IM or oral \\nantibiotic regimens as women without HIV . The microbiologic \\nfindings for women with HIV and women without HIV \\nwere similar, except women with HIV had higher rates of \\nconcomitant M. hominis and streptococcal infections. These \\ndata are insufficient for determining whether women with HIV \\ninfection and PID require more aggressive management (e.g., \\nhospitalization or IV antimicrobial regimens).\\nIntrauterine Devices\\nIUDs are one of the most effective contraceptive methods. \\nCopper-containing and levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs are \\navailable in the United States. The risk for PID associated with \\nIUD use is primarily confined to the first 3 weeks after insertion \\n(1186–1188). If an IUD user receives a diagnosis of PID, \\nthe IUD does not need to be removed ( 59,1189). However, \\nthe woman should receive treatment according to these \\nrecommendations and should have close clinical follow-up. \\nIf no clinical improvement occurs within 48–72 hours of \\ninitiating treatment, providers should consider removing \\nthe IUD. A systematic review of evidence demonstrated that \\ntreatment outcomes did not differ between women with PID \\nwho retained the IUD and those who had the IUD removed \\n(1190). These studies primarily included women using copper-\\ncontaining or other nonhormonal IUDs. No studies are \\navailable regarding treatment outcomes among women using \\nlevonorgestrel-releasing IUDs.\\nEpididymitis\\nAcute epididymitis is a clinical syndrome causing pain, \\nswelling, and inflammation of the epididymis and lasting \\n<6 weeks (1191). Sometimes a testicle is also involved, a \\ncondition referred to as epididymo-orchitis. A high index \\nof suspicion for spermatic cord (testicular) torsion should \\nbe maintained among men who have a sudden onset of \\nsymptoms associated with epididymitis because this condition \\nis a surgical emergency.\\nAcute epididymitis can be caused by STIs (e.g., C. trachomatis, \\nN. gonorrhoeae, or M. genitalium) or enteric organisms (i.e., \\nEscherichia coli) (1192). Acute epididymitis caused by an \\nSTI is usually accompanied by urethritis, which is frequently \\nasymptomatic. Acute epididymitis caused by sexually \\ntransmitted enteric organisms might also occur among men \\nwho are the insertive partner during anal sex. Nonsexually \\ntransmitted acute epididymitis caused by genitourinary \\npathogens typically occurs with bacteriuria secondary to \\nbladder outlet obstruction (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia) \\n(1193 ). Among older men, nonsexually transmitted \\nacute epididymitis is also associated with prostate biopsy, \\nurinary tract instrumentation or surgery, systemic disease, \\nor immunosuppression. Uncommon infectious causes of \\nnonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis (e.g., Fournier’s \\ngangrene) should be managed in consultation with a urologist.\\nChronic epididymitis is characterized by a ≥6-week history \\nof symptoms of discomfort or pain in the scrotum, testicle, or \\nepididymis. Chronic infectious epididymitis is most frequently \\nobserved with conditions associated with a granulomatous \\nreaction. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is the most common \\ngranulomatous disease affecting the epididymis and should be \\nsuspected, especially among men with a known history of or recent \\nexposure to TB. The differential diagnosis of chronic noninfectious \\nepididymitis, sometimes termed orchialgia or epididymalgia, is \\nbroad (e.g., trauma, cancer, autoimmune conditions, or idiopathic \\nconditions). Men with this diagnosis should be referred to a \\nurologist for clinical management (1191,1192).\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nMen who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral \\ntesticular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling'),\n",

Although inflammation and swelling \\nusually begin in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to \\nthe rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord \\nis usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord (testicular) \\ntorsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases; \\nhowever, it occurs more frequently among adolescents and \\nmen without evidence of inflammation or infection. For men \\nwith severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose \\ntest results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary \\ntract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is \\nquestionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation \\nfor testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might \\nbe compromised.\\nBilateral symptoms should increase suspicion of other causes \\nof testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the \\nmost accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is \\nnot routinely available. Ultrasound should be used primarily \\nfor ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, \\nunilateral, painful scrotal swelling. However, because partial \\nspermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal \\nultrasound, differentiation between spermatic cord torsion \\nand epididymitis when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound \\nshould be made on the basis of clinical evaluation. Although \\nultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and \\nswelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal \\ndiagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation \\nconsistent with epididymitis. A negative ultrasound does \\nnot rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical \\nmanagement. Ultrasound should be reserved for men if torsion \\nof the spermatic cord is suspected or for those with scrotal pain \\nwho cannot receive an accurate diagnosis by history, physical \\nexamination, and objective laboratory findings.\\nAll suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be evaluated \\nfor objective evidence of inflammation by one of the following \\nPOC tests:\\n• Gram, MB, or GV stain of urethral secretions demonstrating \\n≥2 WBCs per oil immersion field (737) (see Urethritis). \\nThese stains are preferred POC diagnostic tests for \\nevaluating urethritis because they are highly sensitive and \\nspecific for documenting both urethral inflammation and \\npresence or absence of gonococcal infection. Gonococcal \\ninfection is established by documenting the presence of \\nWBC-containing intracellular gram-negative or purple \\ndiplococci on urethral Gram, MB, or GV stain, respectively.\\n• Positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine.\\n• Microscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-\\nvoid urine demonstrating ≥10 WBCs/HPF .\\nAll suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be tested \\nfor C. trachomatis  and N. gonorrhoeae  by NAAT . Urine is \\nthe preferred specimen for NAAT for men ( 553). Urine \\ncultures for chlamydial and gonococcal epididymitis are \\ninsensitive and are not recommended. Urine bacterial \\ncultures should also be performed for all men to evaluate for \\nthe presence of genitourinary organisms and to determine \\nantibiotic susceptibility.\\nTreatment\\nT o prevent complications and transmission of STIs, \\npresumptive therapy for all sexually active men is indicated \\nat the time of the visit before all laboratory test results are \\navailable. Selection of presumptive therapy is based on risk for \\nchlamydial and gonococcal infections or enteric organisms. \\nT reatment goals for acute epididymitis are 1) microbiologic \\ninfection cure, 2) improvement of signs and symptoms, \\n3) prevention of transmission of chlamydia and gonorrhea to \\nothers, and 4) decreased potential for chlamydial or gonococcal \\nepididymitis complications (e.g., infertility or chronic pain). \\nAlthough the majority of men with acute epididymitis can \\nbe treated on an outpatient basis, referral to a specialist and \\nhospitalization should be considered when severe pain or fever \\nindicates other diagnoses (e.g., torsion, testicular infarction, \\nabscess, or necrotizing fasciitis) or when men are unable to \\ncomply with an antimicrobial regimen. Age, history of diabetes, \\nfever, and elevated C-reactive protein can indicate more severe \\ndisease requiring hospitalization (1193).\\nRecommended Regimens for Epididymitis\\nFor acute epididymitis most likely caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea: \\nCeftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose\\nplus\\nDoxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 10 days\\nFor acute epididymitis most likely caused by chlamydia, gonorrhea, \\nor enteric organisms (men who practice insertive anal sex): \\nCeftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose\\nplus\\nLevofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days\\nFor acute epididymitis most likely caused by enteric organisms only: \\nLevofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days\\n*  For persons weighing ≥150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.\\nLevofloxacin monotherapy should be considered if the \\ninfection is most likely caused by enteric organisms only, and \\ngonorrhea has been ruled out by Gram, MB, or GV stain. This \\nincludes men who have undergone prostate biopsy, vasectomy, \\nand other urinary tract instrumentation procedures.

If the last sexual intercourse \\nwas >60 days before onset of symptoms or diagnosis, the \\nmost recent sex partner should be evaluated and treated. \\nArrangements should be made to link sex partners to care. EPT \\nis an effective strategy for treating sex partners of men who \\nhave or are suspected of having chlamydia or gonorrhea for \\nwhom linkage to care is anticipated to be delayed (125,126) \\n(see Partner Services). Partners should be instructed to abstain \\nfrom sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners are \\ntreated and symptoms have resolved.\\nSpecial Considerations\\nDrug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions\\nThe risk for penicillin cross-reactivity is negligible between all \\nthird-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone) (658,681) \\n(see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin \\nAllergy). Alternative regimens have not been studied; therefore, \\nclinicians should consult an infectious disease specialist if such \\nregimens are required.\\nHIV Infection\\nMen with HIV infection who have uncomplicated acute \\nepididymitis should receive the same treatment regimen as \\nthose who do not have HIV . Other etiologic agents have \\nbeen implicated in acute epididymitis among men with HIV , \\nincluding CMV , salmonella, toxoplasmosis, U. urealyticum, \\nCorynebacterium species, Mycoplasma species, and Mima \\npolymorpha (1192).\\nHuman Papillomavirus Infections\\nApproximately 150 types of HPV have been identified, at \\nleast 40 of which infect the genital area (1194). The majority \\nof HPV infections are self-limited and are asymptomatic or \\nunrecognized. Sexually active persons are usually exposed to \\nHPV during their lifetime (838,1195,1196). Oncogenic, \\nhigh-risk HPV infection (e.g., HPV types 16 and 18) causes the \\nmajority of cervical, penile, vulvar, vaginal, anal, and oropharyngeal \\ncancers and precancers (1197), whereas other HPV infection \\n(e.g., HPV types 6 and 11) causes genital warts and recurrent \\nrespiratory papillomatosis. Persistent oncogenic HPV infection \\nis the strongest risk factor for development of HPV-attributable \\nprecancers and cancers. A substantial proportion of cancers and \\nanogenital warts are attributable to HPV in the United States. \\nAn estimated 34,800 new HPV-attributable cancers occurred \\nevery year during 2012–2016 (1198). Before HPV vaccines were \\nintroduced, approximately 355,000 new cases of anogenital warts \\noccurred every year (1199).\\nPrevention\\nHPV Vaccines\\nThree HPV vaccines are licensed in the United States: \\nCeravrix, a 2-valent vaccine (2vHPV) that targets HPV \\ntypes 16 and 18; Gardasil, a 4-valent vaccine (4vHPV) that \\ntargets HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18; and Gardasil 9, a 9-valent \\nvaccine (9vHPV) that targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, \\n33, 45, 52, and 58. Types 16 and 18 account for 66% of all \\ncervical cancers, whereas the five additional types targeted by \\nthe 9-valent vaccine account for 15%. Types 6 and 11 cause \\n>90% of genital warts. Only 9vHPV vaccine is available in \\nthe United States.\\nACIP recommendations for HPV vaccination (https://www.\\ncdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html) include \\nthe following:\\n• Routine HPV vaccination for all adolescents at age 11 or \\n12 years.\\n• Administering vaccine starting at age 9 years.'),\n",

Although \\nthese interventions might not fully protect against HPV , they \\ncan decrease the chances of HPV acquisition and transmission.\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nHPV tests are available for detecting oncogenic types of HPV \\ninfection and are used in the context of cervical cancer screening \\nand management or follow-up of abnormal cervical cytology or \\nhistology (see Cervical Cancer). These tests should not be used \\nfor male partners of women with HPV or women aged <25 years, \\nfor diagnosis of genital warts, or as a general STI test.\\nApplication of 3%–5% acetic acid, which might cause \\naffected areas to turn white, has been used by certain providers \\nto detect genital mucosa infected with HPV . The routine use \\nof this procedure to detect mucosal changes attributed to \\nHPV infection is not recommended because the results do \\nnot influence clinical management.\\nTreatment\\nT reatment is directed to the macroscopic (e.g., genital warts) \\nor pathologic precancerous lesions caused by HPV . Subclinical \\ngenital HPV infection typically clears spontaneously; therefore, \\nspecific antiviral therapy is not recommended to eradicate HPV \\ninfection. Precancerous lesions are detected through cervical \\ncancer screening; HPV-related precancer should be managed \\non the basis of existing guidance (see Cervical Cancer).\\nCounseling\\nKey Messages for Persons with Human \\nPapillomavirus Infection\\nWhen counseling persons with anogenital HPV infection, \\nthe provider should discuss the following:\\n• Anogenital HPV infection is common. It usually infects \\nthe anogenital area but can infect other areas, including \\nthe mouth and throat. The majority of sexually active \\npersons get HPV at some time during their lifetime, \\nalthough most never know it.\\n• Partners tend to share HPV , and it is not possible to \\ndetermine which partner transmitted the original \\ninfection. Having HPV does not mean that a person or \\nhis or her partner is having sex outside the relationship.\\n• Persons who acquire HPV usually clear the infection \\nspontaneously, meaning that HPV becomes undetectable \\nwith no associated health problems.\\n• If HPV infection persists, genital warts, precancers, and \\ncancers of the cervix, anus, penis, vulva, vagina, head, or \\nneck might develop.\\n• Discussion of tobacco use, and provision of cessation \\ncounseling, is important because of its contribution to the \\nprogression of precancer and cancer.\\n• The types of HPV that cause genital warts are different \\nfrom the types that can cause cancer.'),\n",

HPV \\nalso might be transmitted during oral sex and genital-to-genital \\ncontact without penetration. In rare cases, a pregnant woman \\ncan transmit HPV to an infant during delivery.\\n• T reatments are available for the conditions caused by HPV \\nbut not for the virus itself.\\n• Having HPV does not make it harder for a woman to get \\npregnant or carry a pregnancy to term. However, certain \\nprecancers or cancers that HPV can cause, and the surgical \\nprocedures needed to treat them, can affect a woman’s \\nability to get pregnant or carry a pregnancy to term.\\n• No HPV test can determine which HPV infection will become \\nundetectable and which will persist or progress to disease. \\nHowever, in certain circumstances, HPV tests can determine \\nwhether a woman is at increased risk for cervical cancer. These \\ntests are not for detecting other HPV-related problems, nor are \\nthey useful for women aged <25 years or men of any age.\\nPrevention\\n• Three HPV vaccines can prevent diseases and cancers \\ncaused by HPV . The 2vHPV , 4vHPV , and 9vHPV vaccines \\nprotect against the majority of cervical cancer cases, \\nalthough the 4vHPV and 9vHPV vaccines also protect \\nagainst the majority of genital warts. Only 9vHPV vaccine \\nis available in the United States. HPV vaccines are safe \\nand effective and are recommended routinely for \\nadolescents aged 11–12 years. Catch-up vaccination is also \\nrecommended for older adolescents and young adults \\nthrough age 26 years (https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/hcp/\\nindex.html ). Shared clinical decision-making is \\nrecommended regarding HPV vaccination for certain \\nadults aged 27–45 years who are not adequately vaccinated \\nper guidance (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/\\nwr/pdfs/mm6832a3-H.pdf).\\n• Condoms used consistently and correctly can lower the \\nchances of acquiring and transmitting HPV and developing \\nHPV-related diseases (e.g., genital warts or cervical cancer). \\nHowever, because HPV can infect areas not covered by a \\ncondom, condoms might not fully protect against HPV .\\n• Limiting the number of sex partners can reduce the risk \\nfor HPV . However, even persons with only one lifetime \\nsex partner can get HPV .\\n• Abstaining from sexual activity is the most reliable method \\nfor preventing genital HPV infection.\\nAnogenital Warts\\nAnogenital warts are a common disease, and 90% are caused \\nby nononcogenic HPV types 6 or 11. These types can be \\ncommonly identified before or at the same time anogenital \\nwarts are detected (1206). HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35 \\nalso are occasionally identified in anogenital warts (usually \\nas infections with HPV 6 or 11) and can be associated with \\nfoci of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), \\nparticularly among persons who have HIV infection. In \\naddition to anogenital warts, HPV types 6 and 11 have been \\nassociated with conjunctival, nasal, oral, and laryngeal warts.\\nAnogenital warts are usually asymptomatic; however, \\ndepending on the size and anatomic location, they can \\nbe painful or pruritic. They are usually flat, papular, or \\npedunculated growths on the genital mucosa. Anogenital warts \\noccur commonly at certain anatomic sites, including around \\nthe vaginal introitus, under the foreskin of the uncircumcised \\npenis, and on the shaft of the circumcised penis. Warts can \\nalso occur at multiple sites in the anogenital epithelium or \\nwithin the anogenital tract (e.g., cervix, vagina, urethra, \\nperineum, perianal skin, anus, or scrotum). Intra-anal warts \\nare observed predominantly in persons who have had receptive \\nanal intercourse; however, they also can occur among men and \\nwomen who have not had a history of anal sexual contact.\\nPrevention\\nAnogenital warts have decreased among adolescents, \\nyoung women, and heterosexual men with use of HPV \\nvaccination in multiple countries, including the United States \\n(1203,1207–1216).\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nDiagnosis of anogenital warts is usually made by visual \\ninspection but can be confirmed by biopsy, which is indicated \\nif lesions are atypical (e.g., pigmented, indurated, affixed to \\nunderlying tissue, bleeding, or ulcerated lesions). Biopsy might \\nalso be indicated in the following circumstances, particularly \\nif the patient is immunocompromised (including those with \\nHIV infection): the diagnosis is uncertain, the lesions do not \\nrespond to standard therapy, or the disease worsens during \\ntherapy. HPV testing is not recommended for anogenital wart \\ndiagnosis because test results are not confirmatory and do not \\nguide genital wart management. Some anogenital lesions can \\nresemble anogenital warts (condyloma accuminata), but do \\nnot respond to anogenital wart treatment. Condyloma lata, \\na manifestation of secondary syphilis, can be diagnosed by \\nserologic tests or through direct detection from serous fluid \\nfrom the lesions (see Syphilis, Diagnostic Considerations).\\nTreatment\\nThe aim of treatment is removal of the warts and amelioration \\nof symptoms, if present. The appearance of warts also can result \\nin considerable psychosocial distress, and removal can relieve'),\n",

For most patients, treatment results in \\nresolution of the warts. If left untreated, anogenital warts can \\nresolve spontaneously, remain unchanged, or increase in size or \\nnumber. Because warts might spontaneously resolve in <1 year, \\nan acceptable alternative for certain persons is to forego treatment \\nand wait for spontaneous resolution. Available therapies for \\nanogenital warts might reduce, but probably do not eradicate, \\nHPV infectivity. Whether reduction in HPV viral DNA resulting \\nfrom treatment reduces future transmission remains unknown.\\nT reatment of anogenital warts should be guided by wart size, \\nnumber, and anatomic site; patient preference; cost of treatment; \\nconvenience; adverse effects; and provider experience. No \\ndefinitive evidence indicates that any one recommended treatment \\nis superior to another, and no single treatment is ideal for all \\npatients or all warts. Shared clinical decision-making between \\na patient and a provider regarding treatment algorithms has \\nbeen associated with improved clinical outcomes and should be \\nencouraged. Because all available treatments have shortcomings, \\nclinicians sometimes use combination therapy (e.g., provider-\\nadministered cryotherapy with patient-applied topical therapy \\nbetween visits to the provider). However, limited data exist \\nregarding the efficacy or risk for complications associated with \\ncombination therapy. T reatment regimens are classified as either \\npatient-applied or provider-administered modalities. Patient-\\napplied modalities are preferred by certain persons because they \\ncan be administered in the privacy of their home. T o ensure \\nthat patient-applied modalities are effective, instructions should \\nbe provided to patients while in the clinic, and all anogenital \\nwarts should be accessible and identified during the clinic visit. \\nFollow-up visits after weeks of therapy enable providers to answer \\nany questions about use of the medication, address any side effects \\nexperienced, and facilitate assessment of the response to treatment.\\nRecommended Regimens for External Anogenital Warts (i.e., \\nPenis, Groin, Scrotum, Vulva, Perineum, External Anus, or \\nPerianus)*\\nPatient-applied: Imiquimod 3.75% or 5% cream†\\nor\\nPodofilox 0.5% solution or gel\\nor\\nSinecatechins 15% ointment†\\nProvider-administered: Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen or cryoprobe\\nor\\nSurgical removal by tangential scissor excision, tangential shave \\nexcision, curettage, laser, or electrosurgery\\nor\\nTrichloroacetic acid (TCA) or bichloroacetic acid (BCA)  \\n80%–90% solution\\n*  Persons with external anal or perianal warts might also have intra-anal \\nwarts.

Imiquimod 5% cream should be applied once \\nat bedtime, 3 times/week for <16 weeks (1217). Similarly, \\nimiquimod 3.75% cream should be applied once at bedtime \\nevery night for <8 weeks (1218). With either formulation, the \\ntreatment area should be washed with soap and water 6–10 hours \\nafter the application. Local inflammatory reactions, including \\nredness, irritation, induration, ulceration or erosion, and vesicles \\nmight occur with using imiquimod, and hypopigmentation has \\nalso been described (1219). Limited case reports demonstrate \\nan association between treatment with imiquimod cream and \\nworsened inflammatory or autoimmune skin diseases (e.g., \\npsoriasis, vitiligo, or lichenoid dermatoses) (1220–1222). Data \\nfrom studies of human participants are limited regarding use of \\nimiquimod during pregnancy; however, animal data indicate \\nthat this therapy poses low risk (431).\\nPodofilox (podophyllotoxin) is a patient-applied antimitotic \\ndrug that causes wart necrosis. Podofilox solution (using a \\ncotton swab) or podofilox gel (using a finger) should be applied \\nto anogenital warts 2 times/day for 3 days, followed by 4 days \\nof no therapy. This cycle can be repeated, as necessary, for up \\nto four cycles. The total wart area treated should not exceed \\n10 cm2, and the total volume of podofilox should be limited to \\n0.5 mL/day. If possible, the health care provider should apply the \\ninitial treatment to demonstrate proper application technique \\nand identify which warts should be treated. Mild to moderate \\npain or local irritation might develop after treatment. After each \\ntreatment, the gel or solution should be allowed to dry. Patients \\nshould wash their hands before and after each application. \\nPodofilox is contraindicated during pregnancy (431).\\nSinecatechins is a patient-applied, green-tea extract with an \\nactive product (catechins). Sinecatechins 15% ointment should \\nbe applied 3 times/day (0.5-cm strand of ointment to each wart) \\nby using a finger to ensure coverage with a thin layer of ointment \\nuntil complete clearance of warts is achieved. This product should \\nnot be continued for >16 weeks (1223–1225). The medication \\nshould not be washed off after use.

Local anesthesia (topical or injected) might facilitate \\ntherapy if warts are present in many areas or if the area of warts \\nis large. Surgical therapy has the advantage of eliminating the \\nmajority of warts at a single visit, although recurrence can \\noccur. Surgical removal requires substantial clinical training, \\nadditional equipment, and sometimes a longer office visit. After \\nlocal anesthesia is applied, anogenital warts can be physically \\ndestroyed by electrocautery, in which case no additional \\nhemostasis is required. Care should be taken to control the \\ndepth of electrocautery to prevent scarring. Alternatively, the \\nwarts can be removed either by tangential excision with a pair of \\nfine scissors or a scalpel, by CO2 laser, or by curettage. Because \\nmost warts are exophytic, this procedure can be accomplished \\nwith a resulting wound that only extends into the upper dermis. \\nHemostasis can be achieved with an electrocautery unit or, in \\ncases of minor bleeding, a chemical styptic (e.g., an aluminum \\nchloride solution). Suturing is neither required nor indicated \\nin the majority of cases. For patients with large or extensive \\nwarts, surgical therapy, including CO2 laser, might be most \\nbeneficial; such therapy might also be useful for intraurethral \\nwarts, particularly for those persons whose warts have not \\nresponded to other treatments. T reatment of anogenital and \\noral warts should be performed in a ventilated room by using \\nstandard precautions (https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/\\nguidelines/isolation/index.html/Isolation2007.pdf#page) and \\nlocal exhaust ventilation (e.g., a smoke evacuator) (1226).\\nT richloroacetic acid (TCA) and bichloroacetic acid (BCA) \\nare provider-administered caustic agents that destroy warts by \\nchemical coagulation of proteins. Although these preparations \\nare widely used, they have not been investigated thoroughly. \\nTCA solution has a low viscosity, comparable with that of \\nwater, and can spread rapidly and damage adjacent tissues if \\napplied excessively. A small amount should be applied only \\nto the warts and allowed to dry (i.e., develop white frost on \\ntissue) before the patient sits or stands. If pain is intense or an \\nexcess amount of acid is applied, the area can be covered with \\nsodium bicarbonate (i.e., baking soda), washed with liquid \\nsoap preparations, or be powdered with talc to neutralize the \\nacid or remove unreacted acid. TCA or BCA treatment can be \\nrepeated weekly if necessary.\\nAlternative Regimens for External Genital Warts\\nFewer data are available regarding the efficacy of alternative \\nregimens for treating anogenital warts, which include \\npodophyllin resin, intralesional interferon, photodynamic \\ntherapy, and topical cidofovir. Shared clinical decision-\\nmaking between the patient and provider regarding benefits \\nand risks of these regimens should be provided. In addition, \\nalternative regimens might be associated with more side \\neffects. Podophyllin resin is no longer a recommended regimen \\nbecause of the number of safer regimens available, and severe \\nsystemic toxicity has been reported when podophyllin resin \\nwas applied to large areas of friable tissue and was not washed \\noff within 4 hours (1227–1229). Podophyllin resin 10%–25% \\nin a compound tincture of benzoin might be considered for \\nprovider-administered treatment under conditions of strict \\nadherence to recommendations.

Factors that might affect response to therapy include \\nimmunosuppression and treatment compliance. Warts \\nlocated on moist surfaces or in intertriginous areas respond \\nbest to topical treatment. A new treatment modality should \\nbe selected when no substantial improvement is observed \\nafter a complete course of treatment or in the event of severe \\nside effects; treatment response and therapy-associated side \\neffects should be evaluated throughout the therapy course. \\nComplications occur rarely when treatment is administered \\ncorrectly. Persistent hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation \\ncan occur with ablative modalities (e.g., cryotherapy and \\nelectrocautery) and have been described with immune \\nmodulating therapies (e.g., imiquimod cream). Depressed or \\nhypertrophic scars are uncommon but can occur, especially \\nif patients have insufficient time to heal between treatments. \\nRarely, treatment can result in chronic pain syndromes (e.g., \\nvulvodynia and hyperesthesia of the treatment site) or, in the \\ncase of anal warts, painful defecation or fistulas.\\nCounseling\\nWhen counseling persons with anogenital warts, the provider \\nshould discuss the following:\\n• If left untreated, genital warts might resolve, stay the same, \\nor increase in size or number. The types of HPV that cause \\ngenital warts are different from the types that can cause cancer.\\n• Women with genital warts do not need Pap tests more \\noften than other women.\\n• Time of HPV acquisition cannot be definitively \\ndetermined. Genital warts can develop months or years \\nafter acquiring HPV .\\n• HPV types that cause genital warts can be passed on to \\nanother person, even without visible signs of warts. Sex \\npartners tend to share HPV , even though signs of HPV \\n(e.g., warts) might occur in only one or neither partner.\\n• Although genital warts are common and benign, certain \\npersons might experience considerable psychosocial impact \\nafter receiving this diagnosis.\\n• Although genital warts can be treated, such treatment does \\nnot cure the virus itself. For this reason, genital warts often \\nrecur after treatment, especially during the first 3 months.\\n• Because genital warts can be sexually transmitted, persons \\nwith genital warts benefit from testing for other STIs. \\nHPV might remain present and can still be transmitted \\nto partners even after the warts are gone.\\n• Condoms might lower the chances of transmitting genital \\nwarts if used consistently and correctly; however, HPV \\ncan infect areas that are not covered by a condom and \\nmight not fully protect against HPV .\\n• A vaccine is available for males and females to prevent \\ngenital warts (Gardasil 9) but it will not treat existing HPV \\nor genital warts. This vaccine can prevent the majority of \\ncases of genital warts among persons who have not yet \\nbeen exposed to wart-causing types of HPV .\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nPersons should inform current partners about having genital \\nwarts because the types of HPV that cause warts can be passed \\non to partners. Partners should be counseled that they might \\nalready have HPV despite no visible signs of warts; therefore, \\nHPV testing of sex partners of persons with genital warts is \\nnot recommended. Partners might benefit from a physical \\nexamination to detect genital warts and tests for other STIs. No \\nrecommendations can be made regarding informing future sex \\npartners about a diagnosis of genital warts because the duration \\nof viral persistence after warts have resolved is unknown.\\nSpecial Considerations\\nPregnancy\\nPodofilox, podophyllin, and sinecatechins should not be \\nused during pregnancy. Imiquimod appears to pose low risk \\nbut should be avoided until more data are available. Anogenital \\nwarts can proliferate and become friable during pregnancy. \\nAlthough removal of warts during pregnancy can be considered, \\nresolution might be incomplete or poor until pregnancy is \\ncomplete. Rarely, HPV types 6 and 11 can cause respiratory \\npapillomatosis among infants and children, although the route \\nof transmission (i.e., transplacental, perinatal, or postnatal) is \\nnot completely understood. Whether cesarean delivery prevents \\nrespiratory papillomatosis among infants and children also \\nis unclear (1230); therefore, cesarean delivery should not be \\nperformed solely to prevent transmission of HPV infection to \\nthe newborn. Cesarean delivery is indicated for women with \\nanogenital warts if the pelvic outlet is obstructed or if vaginal \\ndelivery would result in excessive bleeding. Pregnant women \\nwith anogenital warts should be counseled about the low risk'),\n",

In this instance, referral to a specialist for \\ntreatment is recommended.\\nCancers and Precancers Associated with Human \\nPapillomavirus\\nPersistent infection with high-risk (oncogenic) types of HPV \\nhas a causal role in approximately all cervical cancers and in \\ncertain vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers \\n(1238). However, cervical cancer is the only HPV-associated \\ncancer for which routine screening is recommended.\\nCervical Cancer\\nScreening Recommendations\\nRecommendations for cervical cancer screening in the \\nUnited States are based on systematic evidence reviews \\nby major medical and advocacy organizations, including \\nUSPSTF (174), ACS (177), and ACOG (175). Over time, \\ngeneral alignment across these organizations has emerged as \\nto when to start and end cervical cancer screening as well as \\nthe periodicity of screening. Although no single guideline \\nuniversally guides screening practices in the United States, the \\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act required Medicaid \\nand new private health insurance plans to provide coverage for \\npreventive services graded A or B by USPSTF , which includes \\ncervical cancer screening. In addition, the National Center for \\nQuality Assurance provides a set of measures (the Healthcare \\nEffectiveness Data and Information Set [HEDIS]) for up-to-\\ndate cervical cancer screening that aligns with USPSTF \\nrecommendations (https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/measures/\\ncervical-cancer-screening ). The Center for Medicaid and \\nMedicare Services uses the same measure as HEDIS to measure \\ncervical cancer screening performance.\\nUSPSTF screening recommendations apply to persons with \\na cervix at average risk, defined as those with no previous \\ncervical cancer or high-grade precancer, not currently \\nunder close follow-up for a recent abnormal result, not \\nimmunocompromised (e.g., persons with HIV), and who \\nhad no exposure to diethylstilbestrol in utero. Among these \\npersons, screening should be performed starting at age 21 years \\nand continue through age 65 years. T esting can be performed \\nusing either conventional or liquid-based cytologic tests (i.e., \\nPap tests). For persons aged ≥30 years, screening can include \\nFDA-cleared tests for high-risk, oncogenic types of HPV . \\nFor cytopathologic testing, clinics should use CLIA-certified \\nlaboratories using acceptable terminology (Bethesda 2001 or \\nLAST terminology) (1239).\\nAnnual cervical cancer screening is not recommended for \\npersons at average risk. Instead, cytology testing is recommended \\nevery 3 years for persons aged 21–29 years. For persons aged \\n30–65 years, a cytology test every 3 years, an HPV test alone \\nevery 5 years, or a cytology test plus an HPV test (cotest) every \\n5 years is recommended. Cotesting can be done by either \\ncollecting one sample for the cytology test and another for the \\nHPV test or by using the remaining liquid cytology material \\nfor the HPV test. Cervical screening programs should screen \\nthose who have received HPV vaccination in the same manner \\nas those that are unvaccinated. Screening is not recommended \\nbefore age 21 years among those at average risk. For those aged \\n30–65 years, cytology alone or primary HPV testing is preferred \\nby USPSTF; however, cotesting can be used as an alternative \\napproach. ACOG (1240), ACS (177), and USPSTF (174) each \\nhave screening recommendations (1241) (Table 1).\\nClinics should weigh the benefits of each screening strategy \\nas well as their resources, such as time and cost, in deciding on \\nwhich of the three possible screening strategies to implement. \\nDecision analytic models (1242) estimating the benefits, harms, \\nand costs (1243) of several different strategies might be useful \\nin making this determination (174,1244,1245). Adopting \\nrecommended screening and follow-up procedures, including \\nscreening methods, results provision, and follow-up, can lead to \\nsuccess in implementing cervical cancer screening in clinics (1246).\\nPatients should be provided a copy of their test results; \\nthose with normal results should be provided information \\non follow-up visits and the importance of continued cervical \\ncancer screening, if applicable. Those with abnormal screening \\ntests should be managed per published guidelines. National \\nconsensus guidelines are available for the management of \\nabnormal cervical cancer screening tests (1247).

Patients with abnormal cervical cancer \\nscreening test results should be counseled about those results \\n(see Counseling Messages).\\nThe following additional management considerations are \\nassociated with performing Pap tests and HPV tests:\\n• Cytology (Pap tests) and HPV tests should not be \\nconsidered screening tests for STIs.\\n• All persons with a cervix should receive cervical cancer \\nscreening, regardless of sexual orientation or gender \\nidentity (i.e., those who identify as lesbian, bisexual, \\nheterosexual, or transgender).\\n• A conventional cytology test (in which the sample is \\nsmeared onto a dry slide) should ideally be scheduled for \\n10–20 days after the first day of menses. Liquid-based \\ncytology can be performed at any time during the \\nmenstrual cycle.\\n• If specific infections other than HPV (e.g., chlamydia or \\ngonorrhea) are identified at the visit, a repeat cytology test \\nafter appropriate treatment for those infections might be \\nindicated. However, in most instances (even in the \\npresence of certain severe cervical infections), cytology \\ntests will be reported as satisfactory for evaluation, and \\nreliable final reports can be produced without the need to \\nrepeat the cytology test after treatment.\\n• The presence of a mucopurulent discharge should not \\npostpone cytology testing. The test can be performed after \\nremoval of the discharge with a saline-soaked cotton swab.\\n• HPV testing can be performed either as a separate test or \\nby using material from the liquid-based cytology specimen.\\n• In the absence of other indications, the presence of external \\ngenital warts does not warrant more frequent cervical \\ncancer screening.\\n• The sequence of cytology testing in relation to collection \\nof other endocervical specimens does not influence Pap test \\nresults or their interpretation (600). Typically, vaginal \\nspecimens are preferred for chlamydia and gonorrhea \\nscreening; however, during a pelvic examination, endocervical \\nspecimens for STI testing can be collected first.\\n• Persons who have had a total hysterectomy with removal \\nof the cervix do not require screening unless cervical \\nintraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2, CIN 3, or adenocarcinoma \\nin situ was diagnosed within the previous 20 years \\n(175,1247). If the cervix remains intact after a supracervical \\nhysterectomy, regularly scheduled Pap tests should be \\nperformed as indicated (1248–1250).\\n• Health care facilities that train providers on cytology test \\ncollection and use simple quality assurance measures are \\nmore likely to obtain satisfactory test results (as determined \\nby the laboratory).\\n• The use of instruments designed to sample the cervical \\ntransformation zone (e.g., cytobrushes) improves the \\naccuracy of cytology tests (1251).\\n• Both liquid-based and conventional cytology are acceptable \\nbecause they have similar test-performance characteristics.\\n• At an initial visit, providers should ask patients about their \\nrecent cytology test and HPV results and any history of \\nevaluation and treatment (e.g., loop electrosurgical \\nexcision procedure and colposcopy) to assist with \\nmanagement; effort should be made to obtain copies of \\nrecent results. The importance and frequency of screening \\nshould be reinforced.\\nCounseling\\nPersons might believe the cytology (Pap test) or HPV test \\nscreens for conditions other than cervical cancer, or they \\nmight be confused by abnormal results (1252–1254). Health \\ncare providers, as trusted sources of information about HPV \\ninfections and abnormal cytology test results, have an important \\nrole in educating persons about HPV and can moderate the \\npsychosocial impact of abnormal results (1255,1256). Persons \\nshould be counseled on the risks, uncertainties, and benefits \\nof screening (174,1257).\\nAn abnormal cytology test or a positive HPV test can \\ncause short-term anxiety, stress, fear, and confusion, possibly \\ndecreasing the patient’s ability to absorb and retain information \\nand acting as a barrier to follow-up care (1258–1261). A \\npositive HPV test might elicit concerns about partners, worries \\nabout disclosure, and feelings of guilt, anger, and stigmatization \\n(1260). Providers should frame HPV positivity in a neutral, \\nnonstigmatizing context and emphasize its common, \\nasymptomatic, and transient nature. Providers also should \\nemphasize that HPV infections often are shared between \\npartners but it is often not possible to know the origin of an \\nHPV infection; HPV tests might become positive many years \\nafter initial exposure due to reactivation of latent infections \\nin both male and female partners. Having an HPV infection \\nshould not raise concerns about a male partner’s health (1262). \\nProviders should communicate the meaning of both the \\ncytology and HPV test results to patients at screening.\\nProviders also should screen for tobacco use and perform \\ncessation counseling (www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/\\ncommittee-opinion/articles/2011/09/tobacco-use-and-\\nwomens-health). Smoking contributes to the progression of \\nCIN, with both active and passive smoking associated with \\nsquamous cell carcinoma of the cervix in women with HPV 16 \\nor 18 infection (1263–1266).'),\n",

These interventions are more effective if they are \\nimplemented with interventions to increase provider delivery \\nof screening services (e.g., provider assessment and feedback, \\nprovider incentives, and provider reminders). Print materials \\nand online resources are available at https://www.cdc.gov/\\ncancer/cervical/basic_info/screening.htm  and https://www.\\ncdc.gov/std/hpv/facts-brochures.htm. Patient navigators can \\nbe effective in improving both screening and follow-up after \\nabnormal results (1267).\\nKey Messages About Cervical Cancer Screening\\nWhen counseling persons about cervical cancer screening, \\nthe provider should discuss the following:\\n• Cervical cancer can be prevented with regular screening tests, \\nlike the Pap test (cytology) and HPV tests. Those at average \\nrisk should start getting cytology tests at age 21 years.\\n• The cytology test can find abnormal cervical cells, which \\ncould lead to cervical cancer over time, and an HPV test \\ndetects HPV infection of the cervix. The HPV test can be \\nused alone for cervical cancer screening or at the same time \\nas the cytology test (known as cotesting) for those aged \\n≥30 years to 65 years. The HPV test is also used after a \\ncytology test result of atypical squamous cells of \\nundetermined significance (ASC-US) among persons aged \\n>25 years (known as reflex HPV testing).\\n• Positive cytology and HPV tests are markers of cervical \\nprecancerous lesions, which often do not cause symptoms \\nuntil they become invasive. Appropriate follow-up is \\nessential to ensure that cervical cancer does not develop.\\n• HPV is a common infection and is often controlled by \\nthe body without any medical interventions. A positive \\nHPV test does not mean that a person has cancer.\\n• Providers should emphasize that HPV infections often are \\nshared between partners, and it is often not possible to know \\nthe origin of an HPV infection; HPV tests might become \\npositive many years after initial exposure due to reactivation \\nof latent infections in both male and female partners.\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nThe benefit of disclosing a positive HPV test to current \\nand future sex partners is unclear. The following counseling \\nmessages can be communicated to sex partners:\\n• Sex partners do not need to be tested for HPV .\\n• Sex partners tend to share HPV . Sex partners of persons \\nwith HPV infection also are likely have an HPV infection.\\n• Female sex partners of men who disclose they had a previous \\nfemale partner with HPV should be screened at the same \\nintervals as women with average risk. No data are available \\nto suggest that more frequent screening is of benefit.\\n• When used correctly and consistently, condoms might \\nlower the risk for HPV infection and might decrease the \\ntime to clear in those with HPV infection. However, HPV \\ncan infect areas not covered by the condom, and condoms \\nmight not fully protect against HPV (24,25).\\nAdditional messages for partners include the messages for persons \\nwith HPV (see Cervical Cancer Screening; Counseling Messages).\\nScreening Recommendations in Special \\nPopulations\\nPregnancy\\nPersons who are pregnant should be screened at the same \\nintervals as those who are not. A swab, Ayre’s spatula, or \\ncytobrush can be used for obtaining cytology test samples \\nduring pregnancy (1268–1270).\\nHIV Infection\\nSeveral studies have documented an increased risk for cervical \\nprecancers and cancers in individuals with HIV infection \\n(1271–1273). Adolescents with HIV should be screened 1 year \\nafter onset of sexual activity but no later than age 21 years. \\nSexually active persons should be screened at the time of the \\ninitial HIV diagnosis. Conventional or liquid-based cytology \\n(Pap test) should be used as primary HPV testing and is not \\nrecommended in individuals with HIV . Cotesting (cytology \\nand HPV test) can be done in individuals aged ≥30 years with \\nHIV . Annual screening is recommended for persons with HIV \\ninfection; after 3 years of consecutive normal cytology results \\nor normal cotest (normal cytology and negative HPV test), the \\nscreening interval can be increased to every 3 years. Lifelong \\nscreening is recommended among persons with HIV infection.\\nProviders should defer to existing Guidelines for the Prevention \\nand Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and \\nAdolescents with HIV for guidance on cervical cancer screening \\nand management of results in persons with HIV (98).'),\n",

For these reasons, \\ncervical cancer screening and HPV testing are not recommended \\nin immunocompetent adolescents. However, for adolescents \\nwith HIV infection, providers should screen 1 year after onset of \\nsexual activity, regardless of age or mode of HIV acquisition (e.g., \\nperinatally acquired or sexually acquired) (98); such screening \\nis warranted because of the reported high rate of progression of \\nabnormal cytology in adolescents with HIV .\\nHuman Papillomavirus Tests for Cervical \\nCancer Screening\\nClinical tests for HPV are used for the following: cervical \\ncancer screening as a primary test, cervical cancer screening \\nwith a cytology test, triage of some abnormal cervical \\ncytology results, follow-up after abnormal screening test \\nresults, follow-up after a colposcopy in which no CIN 2 or \\nCIN 3 is found, and follow-up after treatment of cervical \\nprecancers. These tests are only FDA cleared for use with \\ncervical specimens, not oral or anal specimens. T esting \\nfor nononcogenic HPV types (e.g., types 6 and 11) is not \\nrecommended (https://www.asccp.org/guidelines).\\nFDA-cleared HPV tests detect viral DNA or messenger \\nRNA. Several FDA-cleared tests for HPV are available for \\nuse in the United States. The Cobas 4800 HPV test (Roche \\nMolecular Diagnostics) and the Onclarity HPV test (Becton \\nDickinson) can detect the presence of 14 oncogenic HPV types \\n(types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and \\n68), as well as individual types 16 and 18, and are cleared for \\nprimary cervical cancer screening.\\nOther HPV tests are cleared for use in conjunction with \\na cytology test or to triage some abnormal cervical cytology \\nresults; they should not be used for primary HPV testing \\nbecause they are not cleared for this purpose. These tests \\ninclude the Hybrid Capture 2 High-Risk HPV DNA test \\n(Qiagen), the Cervista HPV High-Risk DNA and HPV 16/18 \\nDNA tests (Hologics), and the APTIMA HR HPV (Gen \\nProbe) test. All HPV assays should be FDA cleared and used \\nonly for the appropriate indications (https://www.fda.gov/\\nmedia/122799/download) (158).\\nHPV testing should not be performed in the following situations:\\n• Deciding whether to vaccinate against HPV\\n• Conducting HPV tests for low-risk (nononcogenic) HPV \\ntypes (e.g., types 6 and 11)\\n• Providing care to persons with genital warts or their partners\\n• T esting persons aged <25 years as part of routine cervical \\ncancer screening\\n• T esting oral or anal specimens\\nUnlike cytology, samples for HPV testing have the potential \\nto be collected by the patient and mailed to health programs \\nfor analysis, thus self-collection might be one strategy for \\nincreasing screening rates among populations where screening \\nrates are low. Self-collection for HPV testing is not cleared by \\nFDA or recommended by U.S. medical organizations (174).\\nFollow-Up of Abnormal Cytology and Human \\nPapillomavirus Test Results\\nIf the result of the cytology (Pap test) is abnormal, follow-up \\ncare should be provided according to the 2019 ASCCP Risk-\\nBased Management Consensus Guidelines for Abnormal Cervical \\nCancer Screening T ests and Cancer Precursors (158). Clinics that \\nserve clients who might have difficulty adhering to follow-up \\nrecommendations and for whom linkage to care is unlikely should \\nconsider offering in-house colposcopy and biopsy services.\\nConsensus guidelines for management of abnormal \\ncervical cancer screening tests combine patient-level risk \\ndata with clinical action thresholds to generate personalized \\nmanagement recommendations (Table 2). This framework \\nallows management on the basis of risk for CIN 3, not specific \\ntest results. The guidelines were designed to identify persons at \\nhigh risk who require colposcopy or expedited treatment and \\npersons at low risk who might be able to safely defer invasive \\ndiagnostic procedures. The risk-based framework was designed \\nto easily incorporate future revisions, such as the inclusion of \\nnew technologies for screening and management. Use of the \\nguidelines can be facilitated by electronic technology that is \\ncontinually updated, such as a smartphone application or the \\nwebsite (https://www.asccp.org/Default.aspx). \\nThe following are highlights of the new management guidelines:\\n• Colposcopy can be deferred for patients at low risk.\\n ű If a patient has a minimally abnormal test result (i.e., \\nnegative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy HPV \\npositive, ASC-US HPV positive, LSIL, or HPV positive) \\nthat was preceded by a negative screening HPV test or \\ncotest within the past 5 years, follow-up in 1 year instead \\nof colposcopy is recommended (a negative HPV test or \\ncotest performed during follow-up of abnormal results \\nwould not similarly reduce risk).\\n ű Referral to colposcopy is recommended if cytology test \\nresults are abnormal or the HPV test is positive at the \\n1-year follow-up visit.\\n• T reatment can be expedited for high-risk patients.\\n ű If a patient has a high-grade cytology (Pap test) result \\n(i.e., HSIL) and an HPV test that is positive for HPV \\ntype 16, then treatment with a loop electrosurgical'),\n",

An \\nannual digital anorectal examination (DARE) might be useful \\nto detect masses on palpation in persons with HIV infection \\nand possibly in MSM without HIV with a history of receptive \\nanal intercourse ( 98). More evidence is needed concerning \\nthe natural history of anal intraepithelial neoplasia, the best \\nscreening methods and target populations, the safety and \\nresponse to treatments, and other programmatic considerations \\nbefore screening can be routinely recommended.\\nPopulations at High Risk and Digital Anorectal \\nExamination\\nProviders should discuss anal cancer risk with their patients \\namong specific populations to guide management. According \\nto the HIV Opportunistic Infection guidelines and the \\nInternational Anal Neoplasia Society, a DARE should be \\nperformed to detect early anal cancer in persons with HIV \\ninfection and MSM without HIV with a history of receptive \\nanal intercourse (98,1283). DARE is acceptable to patients and \\nhas a low risk for adverse outcomes (1284,1285).\\nData are insufficient to guide initiation of DARE at a defined \\nage or optimal intervals for examination. Whereas anal HSIL \\nis observed among young adults, cancer incidence begins \\nto increase after the early 30s and continues to increase as a \\nfunction of age.\\nPopulations at High Risk and Anal Cytology\\nData are insufficient to recommend routine anal cancer \\nscreening with anal cytology among populations at risk for \\nanal cancer. Certain clinical centers perform anal cytology to \\nscreen for anal cancer among populations at high risk (e.g., \\npersons with HIV infection, MSM, and those having receptive \\nanal intercourse), followed by high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) \\nfor those with abnormal cytologic results (e.g., ACS-US, LSIL, \\nor HSIL). Sensitivity and specificity of anal cytology to detect \\nHSIL are limited (sensitivity 55%–89% and specificity 40%–\\n67%) (1286–1291). Health centers that initiate a cytology-\\nbased screening program should only do so if referrals to HRA \\nand biopsy are available.\\nHRA can be used for diagnosis of HSIL, to monitor response \\nto therapy, or to conduct surveillance of HSIL for evidence of \\nprogression. HRA is the primary method used for diagnosis of \\nsuperficially invasive squamous carcinoma, a very early form of \\nanal cancer that is not palpable on DARE. However, data are \\ninsufficient to conclude whether use of HRA leads to reductions \\nin anal cancer incidence or improves anal cancer morbidity and \\nmortality. An ongoing clinical trial is investigating whether \\ntreatment of HSIL is effective in reducing the incidence of anal \\ncancer among persons with HIV infection (NCT02135419).\\nHuman Papillomavirus Testing\\nHPV tests (using high-risk HPV types) are not clinically \\nuseful for anal cancer screening because of a high prevalence \\nof anal HPV infection among populations at high risk, \\nparticularly MSM (1278,1289,1290). No standard HPV-based'),\n",

Recurrence rates with both provider-\\napplied and patient-applied treatments are high, ranging \\nfrom approximately 50% at 1 year to 77% after 3 years \\n(1289,1292,1293). In addition, evidence exists that HSIL \\nmight spontaneously regress without treatment (1294,1295). \\nShared decision-making about treatment for anal HSIL is \\nrecommended because of limited data on the natural history \\nof anal HSIL, including factors related to progression or \\nregression of lesions.\\nViral Hepatitis\\nHepatitis A Virus Infection\\nHAV infection has an incubation period of approximately \\n28 days (range: 15–50 days) (1296). HAV replicates in the liver \\nand is shed in high concentrations in feces from 2–3 weeks \\nbefore to 1 week after the onset of clinical illness. HAV infection \\nproduces a self-limited disease that does not result in chronic \\ninfection or chronic liver disease. However, approximately \\n10% of patients experience a relapse of symptoms during \\nthe 6 months after acute illness. Acute liver failure from \\nhepatitis A is rare (overall case-fatality rate: 0.5%). The risk \\nfor symptomatic infection is directly related to age, with \\napproximately 70% of adults having symptoms compatible \\nwith acute viral hepatitis and the majority of children having \\neither asymptomatic or unrecognized infection. Antibody \\nproduced in response to HAV infection persists for life and \\nconfers protection against reinfection (1297).\\nHAV infection is primarily transmitted by the fecal-oral route, \\nby either person-to-person contact or through consumption \\nof contaminated food or water (1298). T ransmission of HAV \\nduring sexual activity probably results from fecal-oral contact. \\nAlthough viremia occurs early during infection and can persist \\nfor weeks after symptom onset, bloodborne transmission of \\nHAV is uncommon (1299). T ransmission by saliva has not \\nbeen demonstrated.\\nIn the United States, of the hepatitis A cases accompanied by \\nrisk information, a particular risk was identified among only \\n23.8% (13,372). Among cases with a risk factor identified, a \\nrecognized foodborne or waterborne outbreak was the most \\ncommonly identified risk (49.6%). Other infection sources \\nidentified in the United States include MSM; persons who \\nuse injecting drugs; sexual and household contacts; those \\nexperiencing homelessness; international travelers; those with \\nchildren attending a nursery, childcare, or preschool; and \\npersons working in such settings (13,372).\\nDiagnostic Considerations\\nDiagnosis of HAV infection cannot be made on a clinical \\nbasis alone but requires serologic testing. Presence of IgM \\nantibody to HAV is diagnostic of acute HAV infection. A \\npositive test for total anti-HAV indicates immunity to HAV \\ninfection but does not differentiate current from previous HAV \\ninfection. Although usually not sensitive enough to detect the \\nlow level of protective antibody after vaccination, anti-HAV \\ntests also might be positive after hepatitis A vaccination.\\nTreatment\\nPatients with acute HAV infection usually require only \\nsupportive care, with no restrictions in diet or activity. \\nHospitalization might be necessary for patients who become \\ndehydrated because of nausea and vomiting and is crucial \\nfor patients with signs or symptoms of acute liver failure. \\nMedications that might cause liver damage or are metabolized \\nby the liver should be used with caution among persons with \\nHAV infection.\\nPrevention\\nVaccination is the most effective means of preventing HAV \\ntransmission among persons at risk for infection (e.g., MSM, \\ninjecting drug users, and persons with chronic liver disease) \\nwho did not receive hepatitis A vaccination during childhood. \\nHepatitis A vaccines are prepared from formalin-inactivated, \\ncell-culture–derived HAV . T wo monovalent vaccines (Havrix \\nand Vaqta are approved by FDA for persons aged ≥12 months \\n(Table 3). These vaccines are available for eligible children \\nand adolescents aged <19 years through the VFC program \\n(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html). \\nAdministered IM in a 2-dose series at 0 and 6–12 months, \\nhepatitis A vaccines induce protective antibody levels among \\nvirtually all adults. By 1 month after the first dose, 94%–100% \\nof adults have protective antibody levels, and after a second \\ndose, 100% achieve protective levels (1297,1300,1301). \\nKinetic models of antibody decrease among adults indicate that \\nprotective levels persist for >40 years (1302–1304).

In the United States, IG is produced only from \\nplasma that has tested negative for HBsAg, antibodies to HIV \\nand HCV , and HIV and HCV RNA.

When administered IM <2 weeks after exposure to \\nHAV , IG is >85% effective in preventing HAV infection (1308).\\nIf IG is administered to persons for whom hepatitis A vaccine \\nalso is recommended, a dose of vaccine should be provided \\nsimultaneously with IG in different anatomic sites (e.g., \\ndifferent limbs) as soon as possible, and the second vaccine dose \\nshould be administered according to the licensed schedule to \\ncomplete the series. The combined vaccine can be considered \\nfor persons among whom both hepatitis A and hepatitis B \\nvaccine is recommended (13,1297,1302–1304).\\nSpecial Considerations\\nFor persons with HIV infection, antibody response can be \\ndirectly related to CD4+ T-cell levels. Although persons with \\nHIV who have lower CD4+ T-cell counts or percentages might \\nhave a weaker response to the vaccine, vaccination should \\nnot be delayed for the CD4+ T-cell count to exceed a certain \\nthreshold because of the prolonged risk for HAV exposure \\ncreated by missed opportunities to vaccinate.\\nHepatitis B Virus Infection\\nThe incubation period for HBV infection from time of \\nexposure to symptom onset ranges from 6 weeks to 6 months. \\nThe highest concentrations of HBV are located in blood, with \\nlower concentrations in other body fluids including wound \\nexudates, semen, vaginal secretions, and saliva (1309,1310). \\nHBV is more infectious and more stable in the environment \\nthan other bloodborne pathogens (e.g., HCV or HIV).\\nHBV infection can be either self-limited or chronic. \\nAmong adults, approximately half of newly acquired HBV \\ninfections are symptomatic, and approximately 1% of reported \\ncases result in acute liver failure and death (1311). Risk for \\nchronic infection is inversely related to age at acquisition; \\napproximately 90% of infected infants and 30% of infected \\nchildren aged <5 years become chronically infected, compared \\nwith 2%–6% of persons who become infected as adults (1312). \\nAmong persons with chronic HBV infection, the risk for \\npremature death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma \\nis 15%–25% (1313).\\nHBV is efficiently transmitted by percutaneous or mucous \\nmembrane exposure to HBV-infected blood or body fluids \\nthat contain HBV . The primary risk factors associated with \\ninfection among adolescents and adults are unprotected sex \\nwith an infected partner, having multiple partners, men having \\nsex with men, having history of other STIs, and injecting drug \\nuse (233). In addition, studies have demonstrated other modes \\nof HBV transmission, including premastication and lapses \\nin health care infection control procedures, as less common \\nsources of transmission (1314–1317).\\nCDC’s national strategy for eliminating transmission of HBV \\ninfection includes prevention of perinatal infection through \\nroutine screening of all pregnant women for HBsAg and \\nimmunoprophylaxis of infants born to mothers with HBsAg \\nor mothers whose HBsAg status is unknown, routine infant \\nvaccination, vaccination of previously unvaccinated children \\nand adolescents through age 18 years, and vaccination of \\npreviously unvaccinated adults at increased risk for infection \\n(12). High vaccination coverage rates with subsequent \\ndecreases in acute HBV infection incidence have been achieved \\namong infants and adolescents (1318). The vaccination of \\npersons as children and adolescents likely has led to improved \\nvaccination coverage among adults aged <30 years (1319) and \\ncorresponding lower rates of acute HBV infection among this \\ngroup. In contrast, vaccination coverage among the majority \\nof adult populations at high risk aged ≥30 years (e.g., persons \\nwith multiple sex partners, MSM, and injecting drug users) \\nhas remained low (1320,1321); these groups account for the \\nhighest rates of preventable acute infections (12,1319,1322). \\nSTD clinics and other health care settings providing STI \\nservices to adults at high risk for infection should administer \\nhepatitis B vaccine to those who are unvaccinated.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of acute or chronic HBV infection requires \\nserologic testing (Table 5). Because HBsAg is present in both \\nacute and chronic infection, presence of IgM antibody to \\nhepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) is diagnostic of acute \\nor recently acquired HBV infection. Antibody to HBsAg \\n(anti-HBs) is produced after a resolved infection and is the \\nonly HBV antibody marker present after vaccination. The \\npresence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, with a negative test for IgM \\nanti-HBc, indicates chronic HBV infection. The presence of \\ntotal anti-HBc alone might indicate acute, resolved, or chronic \\ninfection or a false-positive result.\\nTreatment\\nNo specific therapy is available for persons with acute HBV \\ninfection; treatment is supportive. Persons with chronic \\nHBV infection should be referred for evaluation to a provider \\nexperienced in managing such infections. Therapeutic agents \\napproved by FDA for treatment of chronic HBV infection \\ncan achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and \\nremission of liver disease (1323).'),\n",

Three different \\n3-dose schedules for adolescents and adults have been approved \\nfor both monovalent hepatitis B vaccines (i.e., Engerix-B and \\nRecombivax HB); these vaccines can be administered at 0, 1, \\nand 6 months; 0, 1, and 4 months; or 0, 2, and 4 months. \\nA 4-dose schedule of Engerix-B at 0, 1, 2, and 12 months is \\nlicensed for all age groups.

No \\nother adverse events after administration of hepatitis B vaccine \\nhave been demonstrated.\\nPre-Exposure Vaccination\\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all unvaccinated \\nchildren and adolescents; all unvaccinated adults at risk for HBV \\ninfection, especially injecting drug users; MSM; adults with \\nmultiple sex partners; sex partners, needle-sharing contacts, \\nor household contacts of persons with chronic hepatitis B; \\nand persons with diabetes and all adults seeking protection \\nfrom HBV infection (1318). For adults, acknowledgment of \\na specific risk factor is not a requirement for vaccination.\\nHepatitis B vaccine should be routinely offered to all \\nunvaccinated persons attending STD clinics and to all \\nunvaccinated persons seeking evaluation or treatment for STIs \\nin other settings, especially correctional facilities, facilities \\nproviding substance misuse treatment and prevention services, \\nFederally Qualified Health Centers, and settings serving MSM \\n(e.g., HIV infection care and prevention settings). If hepatitis B \\nvaccine is unavailable at a particular facility, persons should \\nbe linked to a setting where they can receive vaccine. Persons \\nwith a reliable vaccination history (i.e., a written, dated \\nrecord of each dose of a complete series) or reliable history of \\nhepatitis B infection (i.e., a written record of infection and \\nserologic results providing evidence of previous infection) do \\nnot require vaccination.

Vaccination of persons who \\nare immune to HBV infection because of current or previous \\ninfection or vaccination is not harmful and does not increase \\nthe risk for adverse events.\\nPrevaccination testing should be performed with HBsAg, \\nanti-HBs, and total anti-HBc to define patients’ HBV clinical \\nstatus and deliver recommended care (1330). Persons who \\ntest HBsAg positive should receive prevention counseling and \\nevaluation for antiviral treatment (see Management of Persons \\nWho Are HBsAg Positive). Persons who test total anti-HBc \\npositive and anti-HBs positive should be counseled that they \\nhave had previous HBV infection and are immune. Those \\npersons with isolated anti-HBc (i.e., negative HBsAg and \\nanti-HBs) need further assessment to rule out occult HBV \\ninfection, and they are at higher risk for reactivation if exposed \\nto immunosuppressants. Persons who test negative to all three \\nHBV seromarkers should receive the complete vaccination \\nseries, with the first vaccine dose administered immediately.\\nPostvaccination Serologic Testing for Response\\nPostvaccination serologic testing for immunity is unnecessary \\nafter routine vaccination of adolescents or adults. However, \\nsuch testing is recommended for persons whose subsequent \\nclinical management depends on knowledge of their immune \\nstatus. Persons recommended to receive postvaccination \\nserologic testing include health care personnel and public safety \\nworkers, persons with HIV infection, sex and needle-sharing \\npartners of HBsAg-positive persons, hemodialysis patients \\nand others who might require outpatient hemodialysis (e.g., \\npredialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or home dialysis), and other \\nimmunocompromised persons (e.g., hematopoietic stem-cell \\ntransplant recipients or persons receiving chemotherapy) (1318).\\nIf indicated, anti-HBs testing should be performed \\n1–2 months after administration of the last dose of the \\nvaccine series. Persons determined to have anti-HBs levels \\nof <10 mIU/mL after the primary vaccine series should be \\nrevaccinated with a 3-dose series and tested again for anti-HBs \\n1–2 months after the third dose. Persons who do not respond to \\nrevaccination should be tested for HBsAg and HBc. If HBsAg \\npositive, persons should receive recommended management \\n(see Management of Persons Who Are HBsAg Positive). If \\nHBsAg negative, persons should be considered susceptible to \\nHBV infection and counseled about precautions for preventing \\nHBV infection and the need for HBIG PEP for any known \\nexposure. If isolated anti-HBc positive (i.e., negative HBsAg \\nand anti-HBs), persons will need further assessment to rule out \\noccult HBV infection and are at higher risk for reactivation if \\nexposed to immunosuppressants.\\nPostexposure Prophylaxis\\nBoth passive and active PEP (simultaneous administration of \\nHBIG [i.e., 0.06 mL/kg body weight] and hepatitis B vaccine \\nat separate anatomic sites) and active PEP (administration of \\nhepatitis B vaccination alone) have been demonstrated to be \\nhighly effective in preventing transmission after exposure to \\nHBV (12). HBIG alone also has been demonstrated to be \\neffective in preventing HBV transmission; however, with the \\navailability of hepatitis B vaccine, HBIG typically is used as \\nan adjunct to vaccination.\\nExposure to a Source Who Is HBsAg Positive\\nUnvaccinated persons or persons known not to have \\nresponded to a complete hepatitis B vaccine series should \\nreceive both HBIG and hepatitis vaccine as soon as possible \\n(preferably ≤24 hours) after a discrete, identifiable exposure \\nto blood or body fluids that contain blood from a person with \\nHBsAg (Table 7).

Persons with HIV should be tested for anti-HBs \\n1–2 months after the third vaccine dose (see Postvaccination \\nSerologic T esting). Modified dosing regimens, including a \\ndoubling of the standard antigen dose and administration of \\nadditional doses, might increase the response rate and should be \\nmanaged in consultation with an infectious disease specialist. \\nAdditional recommendations for management of persons with \\nHBsAg and HIV infection are available (98).\\nHepatitis C Virus Infection\\nHCV infection is the most common chronic bloodborne \\ninfection in the United States, with an estimated 2.4 million \\npersons living with chronic infection (1332). HCV is not \\nefficiently transmitted through sex (1333–1335). Studies of \\nHCV transmission between heterosexual couples and MSM \\nhave yielded mixed results; however, studies have reported \\neither no or minimally increased rates of HCV infection \\namong partners of persons with HCV infection compared \\nwith partners of those without HCV (1334,1336–1338). \\nHowever, data indicate that sexual transmission of HCV \\ncan occur, especially among persons with HIV infection. \\nIncreasing incidence of acute HCV infection among MSM \\nwith HIV infection has been reported in multiple U.S. \\n(96,236,239,1339) and European cities (237,1340–1342). A \\nrecent systematic review reported an HCV incidence of 6.35 \\nper 1,000 person years among MSM with HIV infection \\n(1343). An association exists with high-risk and traumatic \\nsexual practices (e.g., condomless receptive anal intercourse \\nor receptive fisting) and concurrent genital ulcerative disease \\nor STI-related proctitis (237,1342). HCV transmission among \\nMSM with HIV infection has also been associated with group \\nsex and chemsex (i.e., using recreational drugs in a sexual \\ncontext) (1344–1348). Shedding of HCV in the semen and in \\nthe rectum of men with HIV infection has been documented \\n(1349,1350). Certain studies have revealed that risk increases \\ncommensurate with increasing numbers of sex partners among \\nheterosexual persons (1337,1338,1351–1353) and MSM with \\nHIV infection (1349,1354–1357), especially if their partners are \\nalso coinfected with HIV (237,1340,1354–1356,1358). More \\nrecently, acute HCV infections have been reported among MSM \\non PrEP , increasing concerns that certain MSM might be at \\nincreased risk for incident HCV infection through condomless \\nsexual intercourse with MSM with HCV infection (1359,1360).\\nPersons newly infected with HCV typically are either \\nasymptomatic or have a mild clinical illness. HCV RNA can \\nbe detected in blood within 1–3 weeks after exposure. The \\naverage time from exposure to antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) \\nseroconversion is 4−10 weeks, and anti-HCV can be detected \\namong approximately 97% of persons by 6 months after \\nexposure (1361–1364) ( https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/\\nhcvfaq.htm#section3).\\nChronic HCV infection develops among 75%–85% of \\npersons with HCV infection (1365,1366), and 10%–20% of \\npersons with chronic infection develop cirrhosis in 20–30 years \\nof active liver disease (1367).

However, infected persons are a source of transmission to \\nothers and are at risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma \\ndecades after infection.\\nHCV is primarily transmitted parenterally, usually through \\nshared drug-injecting needles and paraphernalia. HCV also \\ncan be transmitted through exposures in health care settings \\nas a consequence of inadequate infection control practices \\n(1314). T ransmission after receipt of blood from donors and \\nfrom transplantation of tissues and organs with HCV infection \\nhas occurred only rarely since 1992, when routine screening \\nof these donated products was mandated in the United \\nStates (1367,1369). Tattoos applied in regulated settings \\nhave not been associated with HCV transmission, although \\nthose obtained in certain settings have been linked to such \\ntransmission (1336). Occupational and perinatal exposures also \\ncan result in transmission of HCV; however, such transmission \\nis uncommon.\\nAcute HCV infection is a reportable condition in 49 states. \\nMatching viral hepatitis and HIV surveillance registries, and \\nmolecular epidemiologic assessments, can facilitate early \\ndetection of social networks of HCV transmission among \\nMSM with HIV infection.\\nCDC recommends hepatitis C screening at least once in a \\nlifetime for all adults aged ≥18 years and for all women during \\neach pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of \\nHCV infection is <0.1% (156). One-time hepatitis C testing \\nis also recommended regardless of age, setting, or recognized \\nconditions or exposures (e.g., HIV infection, history of \\ninjecting drug use, or children born to women with HCV \\ninfection). Routine periodic HCV testing is recommended \\nfor persons with ongoing risk factors (e.g., injecting drug use \\nor hemodialysis).\\nDiagnosis\\nT esting for HCV infection should include use of an FDA-\\ncleared test for antibody to HCV (i.e., immunoassay, EIA, or \\nenhanced CIA and, if recommended, a supplemental antibody \\ntest) followed by NAAT to detect HCV RNA for those with a \\npositive antibody result (1370). Persons with HIV infection with \\nlow CD4+ T-cell count might require further testing by NAAT \\nbecause of the potential for a false-negative antibody assay.\\nPersons determined to have HCV infection (i.e., positive \\nfor HCV RNA) should be evaluated for treatment. Antibody \\nto HCV remains positive after spontaneously resolving or \\nsuccessful treatment; therefore, subsequent testing for HCV \\nreinfection among persons with ongoing risk factors should \\nbe limited to HCV RNA. Persons who have spontaneous \\nresolution or who have undergone successful treatment are \\nnot immune to reinfection.\\nTreatment\\nHCV infection is curable, and persons with diagnosed HCV \\ninfection should be linked to care and treatment. Providers \\nshould consult existing guidelines to learn about the latest \\nadvances in treating HCV infection (https://www.hcvguidelines.\\norg) and with hepatitis specialists, as needed. Persons at high \\nrisk for transmitting HCV to others should be treated both for \\nindividual benefit and to prevent HCV transmission.\\nManagement of Sex Partners\\nBecause incident HCV has not been demonstrated to \\noccur among heterosexual couples followed over time \\n(1334,1371–1373), condom use might not be necessary in \\nsuch circumstances. Persons with HCV infection with one \\nlong-term, steady sex partner do not need to change their \\nsexual practices. However, they should discuss the risk for \\ntransmission with their partner and discuss the need for \\ntesting (234) (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/index.htm). \\nHeterosexual persons and MSM with HCV infection and \\nmore than one partner, especially those with concurrent HIV \\ninfection, should protect their partners against HCV and HIV \\nacquisition by using external latex condoms (237,1358,1374) \\nand HIV PrEP . Partners of persons with HCV and HIV should \\nbe tested for both infections.\\nOther Management Considerations\\nAll persons with HCV infection for whom HIV and \\nHBV infection status is unknown should be tested for these \\ninfections. Those who have HIV or HBV infection should be \\nreferred for or provided with recommended care and treatment. \\nPersons without previous exposure to HAV or HBV should \\nbe vaccinated.\\nPrevention\\nReducing the burden of HCV infection and disease in \\nthe United States requires implementing both primary and \\nsecondary prevention activities. Primary prevention reduces or \\neliminates HCV transmission, whereas secondary prevention \\nidentifies persons through screening and then provides \\ntreatment to reduce chronic liver disease and other chronic \\ndiseases and HCV transmission. No vaccine for hepatitis C is \\navailable, and prophylaxis with IG is not effective in preventing \\nHCV infection after exposure. PEP using direct-acting \\nantivirals is not recommended.\\nPersons with HCV infection should be provided information \\nabout how to protect their liver from further harm (i.e., \\nhepatotoxic agents); for instance, persons with HCV infection \\nshould be advised to avoid drinking alcohol and taking any new \\nmedicines, including over-the-counter or herbal medications, \\nwithout checking with their clinician.

Although the rate of \\ntransmission is highly variable, more than six of every 100 \\ninfants born to women with HCV infection become infected; \\nthis infection occurs predominantly during or near delivery, \\nand no treatment or delivery method (e.g., cesarean delivery) \\nhas been demonstrated to decrease this risk (1375). However, \\nthe risk is increased by the presence of maternal HCV viremia \\nat delivery and is twofold to threefold greater if the woman has \\nHIV infection. Although no recommendations are available \\nfor HCV treatment during pregnancy, discussion about the \\nindividual risks and benefits of postpartum treatment can be \\nconsidered in accordance with existing guidance (https://www.\\nhcvguidelines.org/unique-populations/pregnancy).\\nHCV has not been reported to be transmitted through breast \\nmilk, although mothers with HCV infection should consider \\nabstaining from breastfeeding if their nipples are cracked or \\nbleeding. Infants born to mothers with HCV infection should \\nbe tested for HCV infection; children should be tested for \\nanti-HCV no sooner than age 18 months because anti-HCV \\nfrom the mother might last until that age. If diagnosis is desired \\nbefore the child reaches age 18 months, testing for HCV \\nRNA can be performed at or after the infant’s first well-child \\nvisit at age 1–2 months. HCV RNA testing can be repeated \\nat a subsequent visit, independent of the initial HCV RNA \\ntest result (1376) (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/hcvfaq.\\nhtm#section3).\\nHIV Infection\\nAll persons with HIV infection should undergo serologic \\nscreening for HCV at initial evaluation ( 98) (https://www.\\nhcvguidelines.org). Providers should be aware of the likelihood \\nthat MSM with HIV infection can acquire HCV after initial \\nscreening. Because acute HCV infection acquisition among \\npersons with HIV infection can occur, especially among \\nMSM, and regular screening of those with HIV is cost-\\neffective (238,239,1377), periodic HCV screening should be \\nconducted (1378–1380). For persons with HIV infection, \\nhepatitis C screening with HCV antibody assays (followed \\nby HCV RNA if antibody positive) can be considered at least \\nyearly, for those at high risk for infection, and more frequently \\ndepending on specific circumstances (e.g., community HCV \\ninfection prevalence and incidence, high-risk sexual behavior, \\nand concomitant ulcerative STIs and proctitis). Antibody to \\nHCV remains positive after spontaneously resolved infection \\nor successful treatment; therefore, subsequent testing for \\npotential HCV reinfection among persons with ongoing risk \\nshould be limited to HCV RNA testing only. Indirect testing \\n(e.g., alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) is not recommended \\nfor detecting incident HCV infections because such testing, \\nespecially if performed once a year, can miss persons who have \\nreverted after acute HCV infection to a normal ALT level at \\nthe time of testing (239) ( https://www.hcvguidelines.org ). \\nConversely, ALT can be elevated by antiretroviral and other \\nmedications, alcohol, and toxins. If ALT levels are being \\nmonitored, persons with HIV infection who experience new \\nor unexplained increases in ALT should be tested for acute'),\n",

The course of liver \\ndisease is more rapid among persons with HIV and HCV , and \\nthe risk for cirrhosis is higher than that for persons with HCV \\ninfection alone.\\nProctitis, Proctocolitis, and Enteritis\\nSexually transmitted gastrointestinal syndromes include \\nproctitis, proctocolitis, and enteritis. Evaluation for these \\nsyndromes should include recommended diagnostic \\nprocedures, including anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, stool \\nexamination for WBCs, and microbiologic workup (e.g., \\ngonorrhea, chlamydia [LGV PCR if available], herpes simplex \\nNAAT , and syphilis serology). For those with enteritis, stool \\nculture or LGV PCR also is recommended.\\nProctitis is inflammation of the rectum (i.e., the distal \\n10–12 cm) that can be associated with anorectal pain, \\ntenesmus, or rectal discharge. Fecal leukocytes are common. \\nProctitis occurs predominantly among persons who have \\nreceptive anal exposures (oral-anal, digital-anal, or genital-\\nanal). N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis (including LGV serovars), \\nHSV , and T . pallidum are the most common STI pathogens. \\nGenital HSV and LGV proctitis are more prevalent among \\npersons with HIV infection (545,556,1382). M. genitalium \\nhas been detected in certain cases of proctitis and might be \\nmore common among persons with HIV infection (937,1382). \\nN. meningitidis has been identified as an etiology of proctitis \\namong MSM with HIV infection (1383).\\nProctocolitis is associated with symptoms of proctitis, \\ndiarrhea or abdominal cramps, and inflammation of the colonic \\nmucosa extending to 12 cm above the anus. Fecal leukocytes \\nmight be detected on stool examination, depending on the \\npathogen. Proctocolitis can be acquired through receptive anal \\nintercourse or by oral-anal contact, depending on the pathogen.\\nPathogenic organisms include Campylobacter  species, \\nShigella species, E. histolytica, LGV serovars of C. trachomatis, \\nand T . pallidum. Among immunosuppressed persons with \\nHIV infection, CMV or other opportunistic agents should \\nbe considered. The clinical presentation can be mistaken for \\ninflammatory bowel disease or malignancy, resulting in a \\ndelayed diagnosis (1384,1385).\\nEnteritis usually results in diarrhea and abdominal cramping \\nwithout signs of proctitis or proctocolitis. Fecal leukocytes \\nmight be detected on stool examination, depending on the \\npathogen. When outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness occur \\namong social or sexual networks of MSM, clinicians should \\nconsider sexual transmission as a mode of spread and provide \\ncounseling accordingly. Sexual practices that can facilitate \\ntransmission of enteric pathogens include oral-anal contact or, \\nin certain instances, direct genital-anal contact. G. lamblia is the \\nmost frequently implicated parasite, and bacterial pathogens \\ninclude Shigella species, Salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter  \\nspecies, and Cryptosporidium. Outbreaks of Shigella species, \\nCampylobacter, Cryptosporidium, and microsporidiosis have \\nbeen reported among MSM (259,274,1386,1387). Multiple \\nenteric pathogens and concurrent STIs have also been reported. \\nAmong immunosuppressed persons with HIV infection, CMV \\nor other opportunistic pathogens should be considered.\\nDiagnostic and Treatment Considerations \\nfor Acute Proctitis\\nDiagnosis\\nPersons with symptoms of acute proctitis should be examined \\nby anoscopy. A Gram-stained smear of any anorectal exudate \\nfrom anoscopic or anal examination should be examined for \\npolymorphonuclear leukocytes. All persons should be evaluated \\nfor herpes simplex (preferably by NAAT of rectal lesions), \\nN. gonorrhoeae (NAAT or culture), C. trachomatis (NAAT), \\nand T . pallidum (darkfield of lesion if available and serologic \\ntesting). If the C. trachomatis NAAT test is positive on a rectal \\nswab and severe symptoms associated with LGV are present \\n(including rectal ulcers, anal discharge, bleeding, ≥10 WBCs \\non Gram stain, and tenesmus), patients should be treated \\nempirically for LGV . Molecular testing for LGV is not widely \\navailable or not FDA cleared, and results are not typically \\navailable in time for clinical decision-making. However, if \\navailable, molecular PCR testing for C. trachomatis serovars \\nL1, L2, or L3 can be considered for confirming LGV (553).\\nThe pathogenic role of M. genitalium in proctitis is unclear. \\nFor persons with persistent symptoms after standard treatment, \\nproviders should consider testing for M. genitalium with NAAT \\nand treat if positive (see Mycoplasma genitalium).\\nTreatment \\nAcute proctitis among persons who have anal exposure \\nthrough oral, genital, or digital contact is usually sexually \\nacquired (1382,1388).

For ongoing risk for HIV acquisition, PrEP \\nshould be considered.\\nEvidence-based interventions for preventing acquisition \\nof sexually transmitted enteric pathogens are not available. \\nHowever, extrapolating from general infection control practices \\nfor communicable diseases and established STI prevention \\npractices, recommendations include avoiding contact with \\nfeces during sex, using barriers, and washing hands after \\nhanding materials that have been in contact with the anal \\narea (i.e., barriers and sex toys) and after touching the anus \\nor rectal area.\\nFollow-Up\\nFollow-up should be based on specific etiology and severity \\nof clinical symptoms.

The odor and longer \\nduration of application associated with malathion therapy \\nmake it a less attractive alternative compared with the \\nrecommended pediculicides. Ivermectin has limited ovicidal \\nactivity (1396). Ivermectin might not prevent recurrences \\nfrom eggs at the time of treatment, and therefore treatment \\nshould be repeated in 7–14 days (1397,1398). Ivermectin \\nshould be taken with food because bioavailability is increased, \\nthus increasing penetration of the drug into the epidermis. \\nAdjustment of ivermectin dosage is not required for persons \\nwith renal impairment; however, the safety of multiple doses \\namong persons with severe liver disease is unknown. Lindane \\nis not recommended for treatment of pediculosis because of \\ntoxicity, contraindications for certain populations (pregnant \\nand breastfeeding women, children aged <10 years, and those \\nwith extensive dermatitis), and complexity of administration.\\nOther Management Considerations\\nThe recommended regimens should not be applied to the \\neyes.

Additional ivermectin \\ntreatment on days 22 and 29 might be required for severe \\ncases (1419). Lindane should be avoided because of the risks \\nfor neurotoxicity with heavy applications on denuded skin.\\nFollow-Up\\nThe rash and pruritus of scabies might persist for <2 weeks \\nafter treatment. Symptoms or signs persisting for >2 weeks \\ncan be attributed to multiple factors. T reatment failure \\ncan occur as a result of resistance to medication or faulty \\napplication of topical scabicides. These medications do not \\neasily penetrate into thick, scaly skin of persons with crusted \\nscabies, perpetuating the harboring of mites in these difficult-\\nto-penetrate layers. In the absence of recommended contact \\ntreatment and decontamination of bedding and clothing, \\npersisting symptoms can be attributed to reinfection by family \\nmembers or fomites. Finally, other household mites can cause \\nsymptoms to persist as a result of cross-reactivity between \\nantigens. Even when treatment is successful, reinfection is \\navoided, and cross-reactivity does not occur, symptoms can \\npersist or worsen as a result of allergic dermatitis.\\nRetreatment 2 weeks after the initial treatment regimen can \\nbe considered for those persons who are still symptomatic or \\nwhen live mites are observed.

However, \\nsome of the following guidelines might still apply to male \\nsexual assault survivors. Documentation of findings, collection \\nof nonmicrobiologic specimens for forensic purposes, \\nand management of potential pregnancy or physical and \\npsychological trauma are beyond the scope of these guidelines. \\nExaminations of survivors of sexual assault should be \\nconducted by an experienced clinician in a way that minimizes \\nfurther trauma to the person. The decision to obtain genital \\nor other specimens for STI diagnosis should be made on an \\nindividual basis. Care systems for survivors should be designed \\nto ensure continuity, including timely review of test results, \\nsupport adherence, and monitoring for adverse reactions to \\nany prescribed therapeutic or prophylactic regimens. Laws in \\nall 50 states limit the evidentiary use of a survivor’s previous \\nsexual history, including evidence of previously acquired STIs, \\nas part of an effort to undermine the credibility of the survivor’s \\ntestimony. Evidentiary privilege against revealing any aspect of \\nthe examination or treatment also is enforced in most states. \\nAlthough it rarely occurs, STI diagnoses might later be accessed, \\nand the survivor and clinician might opt to defer testing for this \\nreason. Although collection of specimens at initial examination \\nfor laboratory STI diagnosis gives the survivor and clinician \\nthe option of deferring empiric prophylactic antimicrobial \\ntreatment, compliance with follow-up visits is typically poor \\n(1423–1425). Among sexually active adults, identification \\nof an STI might represent an infection acquired before the \\nassault, and therefore might be more important for the medical \\nmanagement of the patient than for legal purposes.\\nT richomoniasis, BV , gonorrhea, and chlamydia are the \\nmost frequently diagnosed infections among women who \\nhave been sexually assaulted. Such conditions are prevalent \\namong the population, and detection of these infections \\nafter an assault does not necessarily imply acquisition during \\nthe assault. However, a postassault examination presents an \\nimportant opportunity for identifying or preventing an STI. \\nChlamydial and gonococcal infections among women are \\nof particular concern because of the possibility of ascending \\ninfection. In addition, HBV infection can be prevented \\nthrough postexposure vaccination (see Hepatitis B Virus \\nInfection).

Consequently, the following \\nroutine presumptive treatments after a sexual assault are \\nrecommended:\\n• An empiric antimicrobial regimen for chlamydia, \\ngonorrhea, and trichomonas for women and chlamydia \\nand gonorrhea for men.\\n• Emergency contraception should be considered when the \\nassault could result in pregnancy (see Emergency \\nContraception).\\n• Postexposure hepatitis B vaccination (without HBIG) if \\nthe hepatitis status of the assailant is unknown and the \\nsurvivor has not been previously vaccinated. If the assailant \\nis known to be HBsAg positive, unvaccinated survivors \\nshould receive both hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG. The \\nvaccine and HBIG, if indicated, should be administered \\nto sexual assault survivors at the time of the initial \\nexamination, and follow-up doses of vaccine should be \\nadministered 1–2 and 4–6 months after the first dose. \\nSurvivors who were previously vaccinated but did not \\nreceive postvaccination testing should receive a single \\nvaccine booster dose (see Hepatitis B Virus Infection).\\n• HPV vaccination for female and male survivors aged \\n9–26 years who have not been vaccinated or are \\nincompletely vaccinated (11) ( https://www.cdc.gov/\\nvaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html ). The \\nvaccine should be administered to sexual assault survivors \\nat the time of the initial examination, and follow-up doses \\nshould be administered at 1–2 months and 6 months after \\nthe first dose. A 2-dose schedule (0 and 6–12 months) is \\nrecommended for persons initiating vaccination before \\nage 15 years.\\n• Recommendations for HIV PEP are made on a case-by-\\ncase basis according to risk (see Risk for Acquiring HIV \\nInfection; Recommendations for Postexposure HIV Risk \\nAssessment of Adolescents and Adults <72 Hours After \\nSexual Assault). \\nRecommended Regimen for Adolescent and Adult Female \\nSexual Assault Survivors\\nCeftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose\\nplus\\nDoxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day orally for 7 days\\nplus\\nMetronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day orally for 7 days\\n* For persons weighing ≥150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.\\nRecommended Regimen for Adolescent and Adult Male Sexual \\nAssault Survivors\\nCeftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose\\nplus\\nDoxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day orally for 7 days\\n*  For persons weighing ≥150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.\\nClinicians should counsel persons regarding the possible \\nbenefits and toxicities associated with these treatment regimens; \\ngastrointestinal side effects can occur with this combination. \\nThe efficacy of these regimens in preventing infections after \\nsexual assault has not been evaluated. For those requiring \\nalternative treatments, refer to the specific sections in this \\nreport relevant to the specific organisms.\\nOther Management Considerations\\nAt the initial examination and, if indicated, at follow-up \\nexaminations, patients should be counseled regarding \\nsymptoms of STIs and the need for immediate examination if \\nsymptoms occur. Further, they should be instructed to abstain \\nfrom sexual intercourse until STI prophylactic treatment \\nis completed.\\nFollow-Up\\nAfter the initial postassault examination, follow-up \\nexaminations provide an opportunity to detect new infections \\nacquired during or after the assault, complete hepatitis B \\nand HPV vaccinations, if indicated, complete counseling \\nand treatment for other STIs, and monitor side effects and \\nadherence to PEP , if prescribed. If initial testing was performed, \\nfollow-up evaluation should be conducted in <1 week to ensure \\nthat results of positive tests can be discussed promptly with \\nthe survivor, treatment is provided if not administered at the \\ninitial visit, and any follow-up for infections can be arranged. \\nIf initial tests are negative and treatment was not provided,'),\n",

In \\nconsensual sex, the per-act risk for HIV transmission from \\nvaginal intercourse is 0.08%, and for receptive anal intercourse, \\n1.38% (192). The per-act risk for HIV transmission from \\noral sex is substantially lower. Specific circumstances of an \\nassault (e.g., bleeding, which often accompanies trauma) \\nmight increase risk for HIV transmission in cases involving \\nvaginal, anal, or oral penetration. Site of exposure to ejaculate, \\nviral load in ejaculate, and the presence of an STI or genital \\nlesions in the assailant or survivor also might increase risk for \\nHIV acquisition.\\nPEP with a 28-day course of zidovudine was associated with \\nan 81% reduction in risk for acquiring HIV in a study of health \\ncare workers who had percutaneous exposures to HIV-infected \\nblood (1430). On the basis of these results and results from \\nanimal studies, PEP has been recommended for health care \\nworkers who have occupational exposures to HIV (1431). \\nThese findings have been extrapolated to nonoccupational \\ninjecting drug and sexual HIV exposures, including sexual \\nassault. The possibility of HIV exposure from the assault should \\nbe assessed at the initial examination; survivors determined \\nto be at risk for acquiring HIV should be informed about the \\npossible benefit of PEP in preventing HIV infection. Initiation \\nof PEP as soon as possible after the exposure increases the \\nlikelihood of prophylactic benefit.\\nMultiple factors affect the medical recommendation for \\nPEP and affect the assault survivor’s acceptance of that \\nrecommendation. These factors include the likelihood of the \\nassailant having HIV , any exposure characteristics that might \\nincrease the risk for HIV transmission, the time elapsed after \\nthe event, and the potential benefits and risks associated \\nwith PEP (1431). Determination of the assailant’s HIV \\nstatus at the time of the postassault examination is usually \\nnot possible. Therefore, health care providers should assess \\nany available information concerning the characteristics and \\nHIV risk behaviors of the assailant (e.g., being an MSM or \\nusing injecting drugs), local epidemiology of HIV/AIDS, and \\nexposure characteristics of the assault. When an assailant’s \\nHIV status is unknown, determinations about risk for HIV \\ntransmission to the survivor should be based on whether vaginal \\nor anal penetration occurred; whether ejaculation occurred on \\nmucous membranes; whether multiple assailants were involved; \\nwhether mucosal lesions were present in the assailant or \\nsurvivor; and any other characteristics of the assault, survivor, \\nor assailant that might increase risk for HIV transmission.\\nIf PEP is offered, the following information should be \\ndiscussed with the survivor: the necessity of early initiation \\nof PEP to optimize potential benefits (i.e., as soon as possible \\nafter and <72 hours after the assault), the importance of close \\nfollow-up, the benefit of adherence to recommended dosing, \\nand potential adverse effects of antiretroviral medications. \\nProviders should emphasize that severe adverse effects are \\nrare from PEP (1431–1435). Clinical management of the \\nsurvivor should be implemented according to the HIV PEP \\nguidelines and in collaboration with specialists (1436). Health \\ncare providers should provide an initial course of 3–7 days of \\nmedication (i.e., a starter pack) with a prescription for the \\nremainder of the course, or, if starter packs are unavailable, \\nthey should provide a prescription for an entire 28-day \\ncourse. Provision of the entire 28-day PEP medication supply \\nat the initial visit has been reported to increase likelihood of \\nadherence, especially when patients have difficulty returning \\nfor multiple follow-up visits (1437). Routinely providing \\nstarter packs or the entire 28-day course requires that health \\ncare providers stock PEP drugs in their practice setting or have \\nan established agreement with a pharmacy to stock, package, \\nand urgently dispense PEP drugs with required administration \\ninstructions. Uninsured patients or those with high copayments \\ncan be enrolled in a patient-assistance program to ensure \\naccess to PEP medications. An early follow-up visit should be \\nscheduled at which health care providers can discuss the results \\nof HIV and STI testing, provide additional counseling and \\nsupport, provide indicated vaccines not administered at the \\ninitial evaluation, assess medication side effects and adherence, \\nor provide an altered PEP medication regimen if indicated by \\nside effects or laboratory test results.\\nRecommendations for Postexposure HIV Risk \\nAssessment of Adolescents and Adults <72 Hours \\nAfter Sexual Assault\\nHealth care providers should do the following:\\n• Assess risk for HIV infection in the assailant, and test that \\nperson for HIV whenever possible.\\n• Use the algorithm to evaluate the survivor for the need for \\nHIV PEP (Figure) (1436).'),\n",

Investigation of sexual abuse \\namong children who have an infection that might have been \\ntransmitted sexually should be conducted in compliance with \\nrecommendations by clinicians who have experience and \\ntraining in all elements of the evaluation of child abuse, neglect, \\nand assault. The social significance of an infection that might \\nhave been acquired sexually varies by the specific organism, as \\ndoes the threshold for reporting suspected child sexual abuse \\n(Table 8). When any STI has been diagnosed in a child, efforts \\nshould be made in consultation with a specialist to evaluate \\nthe possibility of sexual abuse, including conducting a history \\nand physical examination for evidence of abuse and diagnostic \\ntesting for other commonly occurring STIs (1439–1441).\\nThe general rule that STIs beyond the neonatal period are \\nevidence of sexual abuse has exceptions. For example, genital \\ninfection with T . vaginalis (1442) or rectal or genital infection \\nwith C. trachomatis among young children might be the result \\nof perinatally acquired infection and has, in certain cases \\nof chlamydial infection, persisted for as long as 2–3 years \\n(1443–1445), although perinatal chlamydial infection is now \\nuncommon because of prenatal screening and treatment of \\npregnant women. Genital warts have been diagnosed among \\nchildren who have been sexually abused (1426) but also \\namong children who have no other evidence of sexual abuse \\n(1446,1447); lesions appearing for the first time in a child \\naged >5 years are more likely to have been caused by sexual \\ntransmission (1448). BV has been diagnosed among children \\nwho have been abused but its presence alone does not prove \\nsexual abuse. The majority of HBV infections among children \\nresult from household exposure to persons who have chronic \\nHBV infection rather than sexual abuse.\\nReporting\\nAll U.S. states and territories have laws that require reporting \\nof child abuse. Although the exact requirements differ by state \\nor territory, if a health care provider has reasonable cause to \\nsuspect child abuse, a report must be made (1448). Health care \\nproviders should contact their state or local child protection \\nservice agency regarding child abuse reporting requirements.\\nEvaluating Children for STIs\\nEvaluating children for sexual assault or abuse should be \\nconducted in a manner designed to minimize pain and trauma \\nto the child. Examinations and collection of vaginal specimens \\nin prepubertal girls can be extremely uncomfortable and should \\nbe performed by an experienced clinician to avoid psychological \\nand physical trauma to the child. The decision to obtain genital \\nor other specimens from a child to evaluate for STIs should be \\nmade on an individual basis. However, children who received \\na diagnosis of one STI should be screened for other STIs. \\nHistory and reported type of sexual contact might not be a \\nreliable indicator, and urogenital, pharyngeal, and rectal testing \\nshould be considered for preverbal children and children who \\ncannot verbalize details of the assault (1438,1449). Factors that \\nshould lead the physician to consider testing for STIs include \\nthe following (1449):\\n• The child has experienced penetration or has evidence of \\nrecent or healed penetrative injury to the genitals, anus, \\nor oropharynx.\\n• The child has been abused by a stranger.\\nTABLE 8.

The potential \\nbenefit to the child of a reliable STI diagnosis justifies deferring \\npresumptive treatment until specimens for highly specific tests \\nare obtained by providers with experience in evaluating sexually \\nabused and assaulted children.\\nEvaluations should be performed on a case-by-case basis, \\naccording to history of assault or abuse and in a manner \\nthat minimizes the possibility for psychological trauma and \\nsocial stigma. If the initial exposure was recent, the infectious \\norganisms acquired through the exposure might not have \\nproduced sufficient concentrations to result in positive test \\nresults or examination findings (1450). Alternatively, positive \\ntest results after a recent exposure might represent the assailant’s \\nsecretions (but would nonetheless be an indication for \\ntreatment of the child). A second visit approximately 2–6 weeks \\nafter the most recent sexual exposure should be scheduled \\nto include a repeat physical examination and collection of \\nadditional specimens to identify any infection that might not \\nhave been detected at the time of initial evaluation. A single \\nevaluation might be sufficient if the child was abused for an \\nextended period and if a substantial amount of time elapsed \\nbetween the last suspected episode of abuse and the medical \\nevaluation.

The clinical manifestations of certain STIs are \\ndifferent for children than for adults. For example, typical \\nvesicular lesions might be absent even in the presence of HSV \\ninfection. The following should be performed during the initial \\nexamination, if STI testing is indicated:\\n• T esting for N. gonorrhoeae  and C. trachomatis  can be \\nperformed from specimens collected from the pharynx \\nand rectum, as well as the vagina for girls and urine for \\nboys. Cervical specimens are not recommended for \\nprepubertal girls. For boys with a urethral discharge, a \\nmeatal specimen discharge is an adequate substitute for \\nan intraurethral swab specimen. Culture or NAAT can be \\nused to test for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis.  \\nAlthough data regarding NAAT for children are more \\nlimited and performance is test dependent (553), no \\nevidence demonstrates that performance of NAAT for \\ndetection of N. gonorrhoeae  or C. trachomatis  among \\nchildren differs from that among adults. Only FDA-cleared \\nNAAT assays should be used. Consultation with an expert \\nis necessary before using NAAT in this context, both to \\nminimize the possibility of cross-reaction with \\nnongonococcal Neisseria species and other commensals \\n(e.g., N. meningitidis, N. sicca, N. lactamica, N. cinerea, \\nor M. catarrhalis) and to ensure correct interpretation of \\nresults. Because of the implications of a diagnosis of \\nN. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis infection in a child, only \\nCLIA-validated, FDA-cleared NAATs should be used \\n(837). If culture for the isolation of N. gonorrhoeae  or \\nC. trachomatis  is performed, only standard culture \\nprocedures should be followed. Specimens from the vagina, \\nurethra, pharynx, or rectum should be streaked onto \\nselective media for isolation of N. gonorrhoeae , and all \\npresumptive isolates of N. gonorrhoeae should be identified \\ndefinitively by at least two tests that involve different \\napproaches (e.g., biochemical, enzyme substrate, or \\nmolecular probes). Gram stains are inadequate for \\nevaluating prepubertal children for gonorrhea and should \\nnot be used to diagnose or exclude gonorrhea. Specimens \\n(either NAAT or culture, including any isolates) obtained \\nbefore treatment should be preserved for further validation \\nif needed. When a specimen is positive, the result should \\nbe confirmed either by retesting the original specimen or \\nobtaining another.

Decisions \\nregarding the infectious agents for which to perform \\nserologic tests should be made on a case-by-case basis.\\nTreatment\\nThe risk for a child acquiring an STI as a result of sexual \\nabuse or assault has not been well studied. Presumptive \\ntreatment for children who have been sexually assaulted or \\nabused is not recommended because the incidence of most \\nSTIs among children is low after abuse or assault, prepubertal \\ngirls appear to be at lower risk for ascending infection than \\nadolescent or adult women, and regular follow-up of children \\nusually can be ensured. However, certain children or their \\nparent or guardian might be concerned about the possibility \\nof infection with an STI, even if the health care provider \\nhas perceived the risk to be low. Such concerns might be an \\nindication for presumptive treatment in certain settings and \\nmight be considered after all relevant specimens for diagnostic \\ntests have been collected.\\nOther Management Considerations\\nChildren who are survivors of sexual assault or abuse are at \\nincreased risk for future unsafe sexual practices that have been \\nlinked to higher risk for HPV acquisition ( 1426,1453) and \\nare more likely to engage in these behaviors at an earlier age; \\ntherefore, ACIP recommends vaccination of these children \\nat age ≥9 years if they have not initiated or completed HPV \\nvaccination (see Human Papillomavirus Infections, Prevention) \\n(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/\\nhpv.html). Although HPV vaccine will not protect against \\nprogression of infection already acquired or promote clearance \\nof the infection, the vaccine protects against HPV types not \\nyet acquired.\\nFollow-Up\\nIf no infections were identified at the initial examination \\nafter the last suspected sexual exposure, and if this exposure \\nwas recent, a follow-up evaluation approximately 2 weeks \\nafter the last exposure can be considered. Likewise, if no \\nphysical examination or diagnostic testing was performed \\nat the initial visit, a complete examination can be scheduled \\napproximately 2 weeks after the last exposure to identify any \\nevidence of STIs. In circumstances in which transmission of \\nsyphilis, HIV , HBV , or HPV is a concern but baseline tests \\nfor syphilis, HIV , and HBV are negative and examinations \\nfor genital warts are negative, follow-up serologic testing and \\nexamination approximately 6 weeks and <3 months after the \\nlast suspected sexual exposure is recommended to allow time \\nfor antibodies to develop and signs of infection to appear. \\nIn addition, results of HBsAg testing should be interpreted \\ncarefully because HBV can be transmitted nonsexually. \\nDecisions regarding which tests should be performed should \\nbe made on a case-by-case basis.\\nRisk for Acquiring HIV Infection\\nHIV has been reported among children for whom sexual \\nabuse was the only known risk factor. Serologic testing for HIV \\nshould be considered for sexually abused children. The decision \\nto test for HIV should involve the family, if possible, and be \\nmade on a case-by-case basis depending on the likelihood \\nof infection in the assailant (1448,1454). Although data are \\ninsufficient concerning the efficacy of PEP among children, \\ntreatment is well tolerated by infants and children with and \\nwithout HIV , and children have a minimal risk for serious \\nadverse reactions because of the short period recommended \\nfor prophylaxis (1455).\\nRecommendations for Postexposure HIV Risk \\nAssessment of Children <72 Hours After \\nSexual Assault\\nProviders should do the following:\\n• Review local HIV epidemiology, assess risk for HIV in the \\nassailant, and test for HIV .'),\n",

Potential benefit of treating \\na sexually abused child should be weighed against the risk \\nfor adverse reactions.\\n• Consult with a provider specializing in evaluating or \\ntreating children with HIV infection to determine age-\\nappropriate dosing and regimens and baseline laboratory \\ntesting, if PEP is being considered.\\n• Discuss PEP with the caregivers, including its toxicity, \\nunknown efficacy, and possible benefits, for children \\ndetermined to be at risk for HIV transmission from the \\nassault or abuse.\\n• Provided adequate doses of medication, if PEP is begun, \\nto last until the follow-up visit 3–7 days after the initial \\nassessment, at which time the child should be reevaluated \\nand tolerance of medication assessed (139).\\nConflicts of Interest\\nAll authors have completed and submitted the International \\nCommittee of Medical Journal Editors form for disclosure of \\npotential conflicts of interest.

The organisms causing STIs can also be spread \\nthrough non-sexual means such as blood products \\nand tissue transfer.

These are especially useful for \\nthe diagnosis of asymptomatic infections. However, \\nin low- and middle-income countries, diagnostic tests \\nare largely unavailable. Where testing is available, it is \\noften expensive and geographically inaccessible; and \\npatients often need to wait a long time (or need to \\nreturn) to receive results. As a result, follow up can be \\nimpeded and care or treatment can be incomplete.\\nThe only inexpensive, rapid blood test currently \\navailable for an STI is for syphilis. This test is already \\nin use in some resource-limited settings. The test is \\naccurate, can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, and \\nis easy to use with minimal training. Rapid syphilis \\ntests have been shown to increase the number \\nof pregnant women tested for syphilis. However, \\nincreased efforts are still needed in most low- and \\nmiddle-income countries to ensure that all pregnant \\nwomen receive a syphilis test.\\nSeveral rapid tests for other STIs are under \\ndevelopment and have the potential to improve STI \\ndiagnosis and treatment, especially in resource-limited \\nsettings.\\nTreatment of STIs\\nEffective treatment is currently available for several \\nSTIs.\\n • Three bacterial STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhoea and \\nsyphilis) and one parasitic STI (trichomoniasis) are \\ngenerally curable with existing, effective single-\\ndose regimens of antibiotics.\\n • For herpes and HIV, the most effective medications \\navailable are antivirals that can modulate the \\ncourse of the disease, though they cannot cure the \\ndisease.\\n • For hepatitis B, immune system modulators \\n(interferon) and antiviral medications can help to \\nfight the virus and slow damage to the liver.\\nResistance of STIs – in particular gonorrhoea – to \\nantibiotics has increased rapidly in recent years and \\nhas reduced treatment options. The emergence \\nof decreased susceptibility of gonorrhoea to the \\n“last line” treatment option (oral and injectable \\ncephalosporins) together with antimicrobial resistance \\nalready shown to penicillins, sulphonamides, \\ntetracyclines, quinolones and macrolides make \\ngonorrhoea a multidrug-resistant organism. \\nAntimicrobial resistance for other STIs, though less \\ncommon, also exists, making prevention and prompt \\ntreatment critical.\\nSTI case management\\nLow- and middle-income countries rely on syndromic \\nmanagement, which is based on the identification of \\nconsistent groups of symptoms and easily recognized \\nsigns (syndromes) to guide treatment, without the \\nuse of laboratory tests. This approach, which often \\nrelies on clinical algorithms, allows health workers to \\ndiagnose a specific infection on the basis of observed \\nsyndromes.\\nSyndromic management is simple, assures rapid, \\nsame-day treatment, and avoids expensive or \\nunavailable diagnostic tests. However, this approach \\nmisses infections that do not demonstrate any \\nsyndromes - the majority of STIs globally.\\nVaccines and other biomedical inter-\\nventions\\nSafe and highly effective vaccines are available for \\ntwo STIs: hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV). \\nThese vaccines have represented major advances \\nin STI prevention. The vaccine against hepatitis B is \\nincluded in infant immunization programmes in 93% \\nof countries and has already prevented an estimated \\n1.3 million deaths from chronic liver disease and \\ncancer.\\nHPV vaccine is available as part of routine \\nimmunization programmes in 45 countries, most of \\nthem high- and middle-income. HPV vaccination could \\nprevent the deaths of more than 4 million women over \\nthe next decade in low- and middle-income countries, \\nwhere most cases of cervical cancer occur, if 70% \\nvaccination coverage can be achieved.\\nResearch to develop vaccines against herpes and HIV \\nis advanced, though no viable vaccine candidates \\nfor either infection have yet emerged. Research into \\nvaccines for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and \\ntrichomoniasis is in earlier stages of development.\\nOther biomedical interventions to prevent some STIs \\ninclude adult male circumcision and microbicides.\\n • Male circumcision reduces the risk of \\nheterosexually acquired HIV infection in men by \\napproximately 60% and provides some protection \\nagainst other STIs, such as herpes and HPV.'),\n",

The French named syphilis “the Neapolitan disease”, while \\nthe Italians called it “the French disease”. \\nKey words: syphilis, sexually transmitted infection, history.\\nIntroduction\\nAccording to the definition from 1929, “Sexually \\ntransmitted diseases, also called venereal diseases (af -\\nter Venus, the Roman goddess of love), shall be under -\\nstood as genital diseases caused by a sexually transmit-\\nted infection”. Currently, the term sexually transmitted \\ndiseases (STDs) is more frequently used. These diseases, \\nmore often defined as venereal diseases, result from be-\\nhaviours influenced by socio-economic, psychological \\nand cultural factors. \\nIn 2018, 33,927 newly diagnosed cases of syphilis \\nwere reported in the 29 EU/EEA states, comprising 7.0 \\ncases per 100,000 people in countries with a comprehen-\\nsive surveillance system. The highest rates were noted \\nin Malta, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and Spain, \\n17.9, 17.1, 12.6 and 10.3 cases per 100,000 people, respec-\\ntively. The lowest rates were observed in Croatia, Esto -\\nnia, Italy, Portugal and Slovenia, with fewer than 3 cases \\nper 100,000 people. The incidence rates of syphilis were \\nnine times higher among men than among women, and  \\nthe peak incidence was among those aged 25–34 years \\n(29 cases per 100,000 people) [1].\\nThe spectrum of sexually transmitted infections, \\napart from classic syphilis and gonorrhoea, encompasses \\na wide range of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, viruses, \\nprotozoans, fungi and even insects.\\nGetting to know the history of syphilis should begin \\nwith an attempt to establish the original source of its spread \\nthroughout the world. As it has already been mentioned, \\nTreponema pallidum is a Gram-negative bacteria. It does not \\nabsorb stain and therefore should be visualised using dark-\\nfield microscopy. Although its virulent factors have not been \\nfully understood yet, we know that it enters the body through \\ndirect contact, e.g. abrasions in the skin or sexual contact, it \\nreaches the nearest lymph nodes and spreads through the \\nblood. The basic pathology of syphilis is vasculitis. The dis-\\nease has been divided into several stages [2–4].\\nA primary lesion occurs at the site of spirochaete penetra-\\ntion 3–4 weeks after incubation as a hard infiltration which \\nturns into an ulcer (ulcus primarium). \\nUlcers are single, flat, shallow, round or oval, 0.5–1.5 cm in \\ndiameter with even edges, a slightly recessed even bottom, \\nshiny surface (mucoid secretion), and infiltrated base. Ulcer \\ndisappears, but it seems, that infiltrated base disappears. \\nIt is most often located on the genitalia (female la-\\nbia, posterior commissure, vaginal wall, cervix and male \\ninner plate of prepuce, glans penis), as well as on the \\nlips, tongue, buccal mucosa, anus and fingers. Enlarged \\nlymph node regions are also observed for several weeks. \\nThey are hard, painless, without packages and necrosis, \\nmobile relative to the substrate, with skin unchanged \\nabove [5].'),\n",

It is characterised by severe \\nbacteraemia, skin rash, and a rash on oral mucosa. En-\\nlarged lymph nodes are also for a few months (large, \\nhard, painless, without packages and conglutination, the \\nskin remains unchanged). In the case of early second-\\nstage syphilis, a macular rash occurs most often. There, \\nskin eruptions (spots of similar size – from small to large \\nand of the same round or oval shape) are observed even-\\nly and symmetrically across the body, most often on the \\nside of the torso and on the flexor side of the forearms. \\nThey disappear spontaneously after 2–3 weeks without \\npeeling and without trace, or the disease recurs [6, 7].\\nLate syphilis (lues tarda) occurs a few years after in-\\nfection, in untreated or insufficiently treated patients.\\nAnother problem, more common in the past than today, \\nis congenital syphilis. It is caused by a spirochete acquired \\nby the foetus in the uterus before birth after the 16th week \\nof pregnancy. Early congenital syphilis (lues congenita re-\\ncens) is characterised by profuse rashes: macular (large, \\nconfluent and irregular patches, mainly on the buttocks, \\nface, palms and soles), papular (scattered, most often on \\nthe face and buttocks), pustular and blistering (palms and \\nfeet, oozing erosions with an infiltrated base). In addition, \\nthere are infiltrated changes around natural orifices in the \\nform of radial cracks, contributing to the formation of the \\nso-called Parrot’s scars, and dark red confluent infiltrates on \\nthe buttocks, palms and soles with a taut shiny surface, the \\nso-called “Lacquered buttocks”. However, the first symptom \\nis usually coryza syphilitica as a consequence of ulceration \\nof the nasal mucosa, contributing to respiratory and suck-\\ning disorders as the disease progresses. In the absence of \\ntreatment, there may be permanent bone deformation, the \\nso-called “saddle nose”. About 30% of infected children suf-\\nfer from Parrot’s palsy, which results in motor inertia of the \\nupper limbs and contracture of the lower limbs. In addition, \\nhepatosplenomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated liver \\ntests and haemolytic anaemia are observed [4]. \\nLate congenital syphilis (lues congenita tarda) is most \\ncommonly asymptomatic. About 20% of infected children \\ndevelop interstitial keratitis (keratitis parenchymatosa) \\nbetween the ages of 5 and 30, Hutchinson teeth; Parrot’s \\nscars around the mouth and anus; hearing impairment and \\nmental retardation [8, 9]. \\nIt is worth mentioning that the spirochete Treponema \\npallidum was identified in 1905 by Fritz Richard Schaudinn \\nand Paul Erich Hoffmann. On this basis, August von Was-\\nsermann developed the first serologic test for the diagnosis \\nof syphilis (the Wassermann reaction test) [10].\\nThe history of syphilis\\nBeing aware of the consequences of the disease, we \\ncan delve into the past of syphilis, its appearance in Eu-\\nrope, and connections with Polish history. The dispute \\nabout the origin of this disease had not been resolved \\neven as late as in the twenty-first century, and to this day \\nthe supporters and opponents of the thesis that syphilis \\nwas brought by Christopher Columbus’ sailors have been \\nfighting without solid and sustainable foundations. It is \\nlikely that infected Indians were taken on board caravels, \\nor sailors “spreading” to a new land were infected by \\nbeautiful, red-skinned women. Another idea, similar in \\ntime, talks about the army of Charles VIII and its impact \\non the spread of syphilis in Europe. On 1 September 1494, \\nKing Charles VIII of France invaded Italy with a multina-\\ntional army composed mostly of mercenaries [10].\\nOn the last day of the year, the French troops entered \\nRome, just abandoned by the Spanish and Italian troops. \\nThey remained there for almost a month, carousing and \\nengaging in debauchery. In January, the changed army \\nleft for Naples, with loose manners and discipline, fol-\\nlowed directly by a cohort of beggars and prostitutes. \\nNaples was captured without a single shot fired, and the \\nwinners could indulge in the pleasures of another Italian \\ncity. Due to the lack of other permanent achievements, \\nthe French took away the seeds of Revival from the at-\\ntacked lands. But there were also other seeds, much less \\npleasant, that Charles VIII’s soldiers collected during \\ntheir debaucherous revels – the seeds of a terrible and \\nunknown disease, so unknown that it had no name. The \\nFrench named syphilis “the Neapolitan disease”, and the \\nItalians called it “the French disease” [11, 12]. The first de-\\nscriptions of the disease come from the Battle of Fornovo \\n(1495). It was then that the military doctor, Cumane, re-\\nported what he observed: “many of the knights or in -\\nfantry had spots on their faces and all over their bod-\\nies caused by the boiling of the four humours. Similar \\nto millet grains, they usually appeared on the foreskin, \\non its inner surface, or on the glans, slightly itchy. Often, \\na single spot in the form of an innocent bubble appeared \\nat first, but scratching it resulted in a penetrating ulcer. \\nA few days later, the patients experienced incredible pain \\nin their arms, legs and feet, as well as a sudden ejection \\nof large spots [...] [present] for a year or longer if no treat-\\nment was applied” [13]. Another doctor, also taking part \\nin the Battle of Fornovo, observed people who lost their \\neyes, noses, hands and feet as a result of the disease. In \\naddition, when conducting an autopsy of a woman af-\\nfected by the French disease, he found bone tuberosity. \\nThis is when this cruel disease began to be observed. At \\nthe end of the fifteenth century, the Spanish published \\nthe first extensive medical treatises on this issue, e.g. \\nMarcel Morel’s doctoral dissertation. Regardless of the \\ncountry of origin, all the people writing about syphilis \\nnoticed its connection with the sexual act, which is why \\nthe first advice concerned abstinence and avoiding in-\\ntercourse with infected women. Other pieces of advice \\nwere more practical. It was recommended to carefully \\nwash the genitals with warm water or white wine after \\nintercourse, and in the case of infection, also with herbal \\nsolutions, to sprinkle them with powder composed of,'),\n",

Above all else, however, it was believed \\nthat the symptoms of the disease were divine punish-\\nment for sins, and one should not fight with it. Therefore, \\ninfected people were treated like those suffering from \\nleprosy. They were isolated and hardly anyone wanted to \\nhave any contact with them.\\nAnother way of dealing with syphilis by the then \\ndoctors was to remove ulcers by cauterisation. For this \\npurpose, they used ointments containing mercury. In pa-\\ntients, the lesions were rubbed with ointment once or \\ntwice a  day and the patients were locked in a steam bath \\nat a very high temperature. The treatment lasted from  \\n20 to 30 days and was so painful that most of the pa-\\ntients preferred death, all the more so because this bar -\\nbaric procedure was effective for only one in one hun-\\ndred patients. \\nThe beginnings of “the Neapolitan disease” made all \\nthe Europeans terrified. After the description of the first \\ncases, there came a time to name the disease. Syphilis \\nappeared. Hieronymus Fracastorius was born in Verona \\nin 1483. A colleague of Copernicus at the University of \\nPadua where he studied medicine and philosophy at the \\nsame time, he was the author of many works. He died, \\nfamous and respected, in 1553 near his birthplace. His \\nwork “Syphilis sive morbus gallicus” (“Syphilis or the \\nFrench Disease”) brought him fame. It was a long Latin \\npoem telling the story of Syphilus, a  shepherd who in-\\nsulted the god of sun by knocking down his altars, for \\nwhich he was punished with a venereal disease. The in-\\nhabitants of the surrounding villages named the disease \\n“syphilis” in memory of the one who was first infected. \\nThe name, however, was not accepted in everyday life \\nuntil the end of the eighteenth century [14, 15].\\nOver the centuries, syphilis appeared both in simple \\nburgher houses and in the chambers of European kings \\nand rulers. Since its occurrence was commonly associ-\\nated with prostitution, the approaches to widespread \\nworldwide prostitution changed. Thus, this “oldest pro-\\nfession in the world” was no longer treated with toler -\\nance. There were orders to put prostitution under police \\nsupervision along with the obligation for women to un-\\ndergo medical examination once a week. Despite all of \\nthis, the disease appeared in many forms, depending \\non geographical, weather and demographic conditions. \\nThe attempts to standardise legal regulations related to \\nprostitution in France were undertaken in the twentieth \\ncentury, e.g. by creating a decree of the Ministry of the \\nInterior addressed to the prefects, confirming the regula-\\ntion of prostitution (1940), and a law “for prevention and \\ncombating venereal diseases”, implementing, in particu-\\nlar, the obligation for doctors to report cases of venereal \\ndiseases to the health authorities (1942).\\nSyphilis affected so many people that it was impossi-\\nble to mention their names. It was even more embarrass-\\ning among royal families than among lower classes. On \\nmany occasions, for fear of infection, every person “en-\\ntering” the bed of a ruler was examined and controlled \\nfor the signs of any disease. It was also the case that the \\nrulers were infected by their lovers, and then, unaware, \\ngave this quite an original “gift” to their spouses. In this \\nway, syphilis had unlimited possibilities to spread among \\nupper classes that were not using, at least officially, the \\nservices of women of easy virtue. For a long time, the in-\\nfertility of monarchs was attributed to syphilis, however, \\nas it was later scientifically proven, there was no direct \\nlink between these cases. Nevertheless, the fact is that \\na woman suffering from syphilis is much more likely to \\nhave a miscarriage or give birth to a dead baby.\\nThe history of syphilis also has its influence and a rich \\ncollection of literature in Poland. A well-known medical \\nhistorian, Kazimierz Lejman, wrote about it. The most \\nextensive outline of syphilis was presented by Andrzej \\nStapiński in his book titled “Zwalczanie kiły i rzeżączki \\nw Polsce” (“Fighting Syphilis and Gonorrhoea in Poland”). \\nThe first records of “the Neapolitan disease” in Polish \\nlands dated back to the early fifteenth or even fourteenth \\ncentury and it is still under discussion today on the origin \\nof syphilis from America. The speed of spreading the dis-\\nease in Europe suggests that it was brought to Polish lands \\nat the same time. Here it was called a court disease, but \\nthe ways of dealing with it proved that it also affected the \\ncommon people. As early as in 1528, behind the city walls, \\na hospital for venereal patients was established in Krakow. \\nIt resembled today’s medical facilities in name only. The \\nname isolation facilities would be more appropriate here. It \\nwas established in the fashion of a Paris institution of the \\nsame purpose. In the sixteenth century, like in Western Eu-\\nrope, treatment was based on rubbing mercury ointments. \\nDue to the fact that it was expensive and folk healers and \\ndoctors had no experience, another way of dealing with \\nthe disease was invented. The naked patient was buried \\nup to his neck in dung, which was to “pull out” the dis-\\nease [16, 17]. When new isolation facilities where the dis-\\nease was treated with the use of mercury appeared, this \\nmethod was slowly abandoned, yet it survived until the \\neighteenth century [18, 19]. Such a facility was established \\nin Warsaw in 1590 by the Jesuit Piotr Skarga. Syphilis was \\nthe subject of many medical dissertations, e.g. “Przymiot” \\n(“Attribute”) by Wojciech Oczko. It explains the essence of \\nthe disease on the basis of the so-called humoral theory. \\nIt asserts that the human body consists of four humours: \\nblood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile, and their mutual \\nbalance is important for health. Any humoral disorder is \\nthe cause of many diseases. This is why syphilis was treat-\\ned with blood drops at that time. There are no descriptions \\nof syphilis in Poland from the seventeenth century. How-\\never, that does not mean that the problem was at least \\nhalf solved.

Earlier \\nlive births with similar symptoms were probably not yet \\nassociated with this disease. These children were aban-\\ndoned, and their number was so large that special wards \\nwere established in hospitals for them.\\nChanges resulting from invasions by oppressors to Pol-\\nish lands did not have any significant impact on the his-\\ntory of syphilis. It developed freely, claiming more victims. \\nThe life of the rulers of Polish lands was also not free \\nfrom the risk of being infected with syphilis. The high prob-\\nability of infection concerned Alexander Jagiellon (died in \\n1506), who led a very debaucherous lifestyle. Due to the \\nuncertainty of the cause of his death, King Władysław IV \\nVasa was also thought to be infected with syphilis. The \\nmost famous example of syphilis among Polish rulers \\nis still considered to be Marie de la Grange d’Arquien, \\nQueen of Poland, known also by the diminutive form \\n“Marysieńka”. She was probably infected by her first hus-\\nband, Jan Zamoyski. However, this did not prevent Jan So-\\nbieski from loving her to death and writing letters to her, \\nwhich became a masterpiece of erotic lyricism. \\nIn Poland, as we can see, the history of “the Neapoli-\\ntan disease” did not differ significantly from the place of \\nits first reign. Each country has an episode in its history, \\nand only the names of the infected people change. \\nFinally, it is worth taking a look at the current situ-\\nation of syphilis since it will also be a part of our his-\\ntory 1 day. The incidence of syphilis, like of most sexually \\ntransmitted diseases, is increasing. Recent epidemiologic \\ndata show an average increase of 9000 cases per quarter. \\nSerological tests, the best known of which is the Was-\\nsermann test (based on IgG class antibodies) [20] allow \\nfor early diagnosis of the disease. However, it should \\nbe borne in mind that the oldest test used to diagnose \\nsyphilis is VDRL. It was invented before World War I, with \\nits first iteration developed by August Paul von Wasser-\\nman with the aid of Albert Neisser in 1906. The medica-\\ntion of choice is penicillin, which should be administered \\nfor 3 weeks to patients who have had syphilis for longer \\nthan a year. It was discovered in 1943, which has forever \\nchanged the fate of the patients. The methods presented \\nearlier in the text were more often “punishment for sins” \\nthan for relief of suffering, and their final effect was not \\nas good as expected. Mercury and guaiacum treatments \\nwere the two alternatives in the fifteenth and sixteenth \\ncentury, and scientists were proving their effectiveness \\ninterchangeably. The historical significance of treating \\nsyphilis with Salvarsan (“the arsenic that saved”) or com-\\npound 606 (the name derives from the 606th compound \\ninjected by Ehrlich into syphilis-infected rabbits in 1909) \\nshould also be emphasised. Due to its adverse effects, it \\nwas then withdrawn and replaced with Neosalvarsan or \\ncompound 914 (again after the number of injections into \\nrabbits) [21].\\nSyphilis in the artistic context\\nWhen discussing the history of syphilis, the artistic \\ncontext dating back to the sixth century must not be \\noverlooked: a Peruvian jug depicted a mother suffering \\nfrom syphilis, with a characteristic saddle nose and su-\\nperior incisive teeth with notches on their free margins. \\nIn Europe, the German artist Albrecht Dürer depicted \\nin 1496 the image of a mercenary whose skin bears mul-\\ntiple sores, and a text by a physician Theodorus Ulse-\\nnius warning against the new disease, also describing \\nits signs and symptoms [22, 23]. An artwork by Sebastian \\nBrandt also comes from the same year. It depicts the Vir-\\ngin Mary and the Christ Child shooting light arrows to \\npunish or heal those infected with syphilis [22, 24].\\nOther prominent pictures include those by Jacques \\nLaniet from the seventeenth century, Luca Giordano, \\nSadeler [24] and a portrait of Gerard de Lairesse painted \\nby Rembrandt in the seventeenth century, clearly empha-\\nsising the effects of syphilis, namely the saddle nose [25]. \\n“Inheritance” by the Norwegian painter Edvard \\nMunch portrays a  young crying mother holding a child \\nwith symptoms of syphilis.  \\nThe artwork “Les Demoiselles d´Avignon” by Pablo \\nPicasso, originally called “The Wages of Sin”, features \\na sailor among prostitutes, and a medical student hold-\\ning a skull as a symbol of mortality. \\nThe symptoms of syphilis are also present in Krakow \\nworks of art. Dermatologist and venereologist Franciszek \\nWalter noticed the following skin lesions among probably \\nfifteen-century-old inhabitants of Krakow, carved by Wit \\nStwosz with senile warts (verruca senilis), basal cell car-\\ncinoma (epithelioma), rosacea (in Walter: “rubella”, acne \\nrosacea), or varicose veins of the lower limbs (varices ex-\\ntremitatum inferiorum) [16, 26]. \\nIn 1932, Walter also noticed symptoms of congenital \\nsyphilis in “The Arrest of Jesus” scene in a figure called by \\nWalter, a Pharisee with a huge wide and hairless square \\nskull, with a huge convex forehead and clearly protrud-\\ning frontal bumps (tubera frontalia). He noticed “eyes \\nin deeply set eye sockets, with protruding bone rims”, \\n“exophthalmos (exophtalmus)”, “convergent strabismus \\n(strabismus convergens)”, “there are eyebrows, but no \\neyelashes”, “narrow and sunken upper lip due to lack \\nof base bone”, “much paler right pupil, blurred cornea \\npattern”, and finally, what is most characteristic, “saddle \\nnose” (in other words: “bulldog nose”, “ram”, “blunt”, \\n“binocular”). On the other hand, in the “Christ Among \\nScientists” scene, congenital syphilis can be seen in a sci-\\nentist with a saddle nose. In the same year, Walter began \\ncollecting photographic documentation of his patients’ \\ntattoos, which may indicate Walter’s interest in medicine, \\npsychology, sociology or arts [16].\\nIn the 14th-century basement of the building situated \\nat Rynek Główny 23 in Krakow, a keystone with a face \\ndescribed as “negroid” or “perfect understanding of cari-'),\n",

To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of \\nthe travel or contact history of the patient with compatible symptoms.   \\n1.

As of May 22, 2022, the total number \\nof countries have confirmed outbreaks has risen to 15. The United Arab \\nEmirates (UAE) is the first Arab country to report an infected case on \\nMay 24 [ 3 ].

Virology \\nMPXV is a lipoprotein membrane-enveloped double-helix DNA virus \\nof the genus Orthopoxvirus, that belongs to the Poxviridae family and \\nthe chordopoxvirinae subfamily [8,9,12]. The Poxviridae is an ancient \\nvirus family that has been found in insects, reptiles, birds, and mammals, \\nand is thought to form visible “pox” prior to vertebrate-invertebrate \\ndivergence [13,14]. \\nAlthough the poxviruses genome contains all requirement proteins to \\nreplicate, transcribe, assembly and exit, it needs infected individuals’ \\nribosomes to translate mRNA [12]. \\nAlong with MPXV, there are three more types of orthopoxvirus that \\nalso effect humans, including variola major virus -the cause of smallpox- \\n, variola minor virus (Variola alastrim), and cowpox virus (vaccinia) [9]. \\nMPXV is considered a large virus which measure about 200–250 nm \\nwith the appearance “brick-like” or ovoid shape [12]. \\nMPXV has two distinguished hereditary subgroups, the West African \\nand the Central African (Congo Basin) which motivates more serious \\ninfection and is believed to cause a higher infective possibility. In spite \\nof the fact that there are different geographical incidence locations be -\\ntween the two virus categories, they both occurred in the same country \\n“Cameroon” [8,9]. \\nThe virus’s original source is wild animals. It can be found in a va -\\nriety of mammals including squirrels, mangabey monkeys and Gambian \\nrats. Even though the essential host continues to be not clear, the rodents \\nare believed to be the host reservoir rather than monkeys [9,13,15]. \\nHuman MPXV transmission happens in two ways, either from \\nanimal-to-human or human-to-human. Aerosol transmission has been \\ndemonstrated between animal populations [9]. Contacting with a pa -\\ntient’s respiratory droplets, lesions, body fluids and polluted personal \\nobjects support the virus spreading among peoples. Furthermore, \\nhospital-acquired transmission has been confirmed, whereas intercourse \\ntransmission is suspected for the patient with genital MPXV lesions. \\nHowever, zoonotic transmission can exist if people contact or eat an \\ninfected animal, In addition to direct connect with natural host’s blood \\nand body fluids [8,13]. \\n3. Clinical manifestations \\nMPXV has an incubation period ranging from five days to three \\nweeks [9,16], and the symptoms can last for nearly 2–5 weeks. Early \\nsymptoms include shivers, headaches, fainting, backaches, and myo -\\ndynia, but they are not specific [9]. \\nThe most common symptoms observed before the the rash devel -\\nopment are fever, restlessness and lymphadenopathy [16]. Human MPX \\nhas similar clinical features to ordinary and modified smallpox [16,17], \\nbut generally more moderate [18]. As swollen lymph nodes are not a \\ncommon sign of smallpox and are seen in 90% of MPX patients [9]. They \\nare considered a distinctive hallmark of MPX. These enlargements can \\nbe observed in the neck, the groin and submandibular areas [16]. \\nDuring the five days following the fever, various sizes of rashes \\ndevelop, initially on the face and then spreading across the trunk area \\nand extremities. The rashes often appear on the palms and soles of the \\nfeet [9]. These lesions measure approximately 0.5 cm in diameter, and \\nsome can reach up to 1 cm [18]. Exanthems progress through different \\ndevelopmental phases, resolving into crusts that fall off during the \\nhealing phase [9]. Lesion co-infection is recurrent and plays a major role \\nin future skin marking [17]. \\nWhile MPX symptoms are less severe than those of smallpox, it is still \\nconsidered a fatal disease, that causes death at a fluctuating rate of up to \\n10% [9]. Death usually occurs within the second week of the infection \\n[16]. The risk is higher in children and young adults, and the disease can \\ntake a severe course in immunocompromised patients [19]. The disease \\ncan present with numerous complications, such as co-infections, respi -\\nratory disorders, encephalitis, blindness-related keratitis, and gastroin -\\ntestinal symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea [9]. \\nSmallpox vaccination can offer some protection against MPX and can \\nalter the course of the disease. Studies between 1980 and 1990 indicated \\na change in the pathogenesis of human MPX, because more people \\nwithout immunity to smallpox developed the disease. Moreover, the \\npathological picture was less severe in the vaccination group, and the \\nskin infection was milder. This was in contrast to the unvaccinated, \\nwhose skin infection was more severe, with multiple forms and a higher \\nprobability of death [20–23]. \\nSince the symptoms of MPX are varied and non-specific, many dis -\\neases can be included in a differential diagnosis. The differential di -\\nagnoses are: chickenpox (the most clinically similar disease), water \\nwarts, red measles, rickettsia disease, staphylococcus skin infections, \\nbacillus anthracis, itch mites, syphilis, and drug reactions for non- \\ninfectious causes of rashes [24]. \\nSince lymphatic adenopathy is one of the most frequently observed \\nsymptoms, which is a differential sign from other diseases, it is imper -\\native to emphasize its importance in the initial examination of a sus -\\npected patient. \\n4. Diagnosis \\nIn order to diagnose monkeypox, health providers should collect a \\nproper specimen and send it carefully to a capable lab. Verifying human \\nMPX virus relies on the sample type and the available laboratory tests \\n[2]. \\nAs the illness symptoms are still difficult to identify and hard to \\nminimize in low-income countries. It poses a world challenge since these \\nareas are considered endemic with this disease [23]. \\nThe confirming techniques that are used for analyzing specimens and \\ndetermine MPX include genetic, phenotypic and immunological \\nmethods [13]. Table 1 lists the diagnostic methods that can be used to \\nidentify human MPX. These approaches work better when are combined \\nwith the medical and epidemiological information including the pa -\\ntient’s immunization history [23]. \\nA detailed medical history with focus on specific information, such as \\nrecent traveling to an endemic area, vaccinating with the smallpox \\nvaccine, along with linking clinical information to the existing symp -\\ntoms, can be extremely directing to the disease diagnosis, but it is not \\nsufficient to establish a definitive one. The golden test to establish the \\ndiagnose is the polymerase chain reaction. Beside its high accuracy and \\nsensitivity, the viral DNA within the lesion persists constant for a long \\ntime if kept in a dark and comparatively cool atmosphere [23]. \\nAs Real-time PCR needs high quality labs which are hard to be found \\nin low-resources countries. The upcoming technologies are reliable on to \\ndevelop the PCR and qPCR to overcome their consequences and become \\navailable outside the large laboratories, which allows to have an accu -\\nrate diagnostic tool within the reach of all medical staff, even those in \\npoor countries. \\nEstablishing the conditions source requires an antibody-based diag -\\nnosing. Immunological tests against orthopoxviruses have a cross- \\nreactivity with other Orthopoxviruses. Still, these tests may be valu -\\nable when there is previous indication to explain the disease cause. \\nAlthough IgG alone cannot provide a definitive diagnosis to a patient \\nwho has been exposed to orthopoxvirus during his life through vacci -\\nnation, IgM is considered more effective in diagnosing newly infections \\npatients retrospectively [23,25]. \\nMPX patients often pursue medical help at countryside health centers \\nor hospices which are not provided with electricity [23]; therefore, it is \\nrequirement to improve the current tests so it can be used in developing \\ncountries where there is lack in resources and human performing. \\nM.

Prevention \\nEver since the SARS outbreak in 2003 and even earlier, experts have \\nrealized the grave threat of zoonotic infections rising from constant \\nremodeling of ecosystems, as per a report issued by the Institute of \\nMedicine back in 2003 as a follow up to their 1992 report [ 27 ]. MPX is \\none such infection that is portrayed by the World Health Organization \\n(WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as an \\nemergent disease [ 28 ]. Preventing the spread of MPX is a war fought on \\nmany fronts: \\nOn the ecological front, limiting humans ’ exposure to suspect host \\nanimals must be the first step as available evidence indicates that \\nhuman-to-human transmission cannot sustain the continuance of an \\nendemic without repeated zoonotic introductions [ 15 ]. This can be \\nachieved by limiting people ’ s dependence on hosts, in particularly ro -\\ndents, as protein sources and instead relying on vegetarian alternatives \\n[ 15 ]. In addition, urban expansion into reclaimed forest lands must be \\nstudied as to prevent displacement of reservoir animals [ 29 ]. Ecological \\nprevention is especially important as future strains may not need \\nrepeated introductions if their transmissibility among humans increased \\n[ 29 ]. Another front would be to protect at risk groups, which include \\nhealth care workers, contacts of MPX patients, and workers in rural \\nareas. CDC recommends that this protection can be achieved through \\nsmall pox vaccines [ 9 ], As data shows that the smallpox vaccine pro -\\nvides 85% protection against MPX via cross-immunity [ 30 ]. The prob -\\nlem regarding this approach is that first and second generations of \\nsmallpox vaccines can cause adverse side effects, which promotes the \\nimportance of developing third generation vaccines like INVAMUNE, \\nwhich as for now, have proved efficient and safe in people infected with \\nHIV or atopic dermatitis [ 31 ]. This is especially important in areas \\nendemic to MPX as no accurate estimations of HIV infections exist in \\nthese countries [ 31 ]. \\nIn hospital settings, the CDC recommends that patients are to be \\nisolated in negative pressure rooms and that health care professionals \\ntake adequate contact and droplet precautions [ 12 ]. This is the stan -\\ndardized response for a patient presenting with fever and disseminated \\nvesicular or pustular rash [ 32 ]. Data shows that MPX is less trans -\\nmissible among humans in comparison with smallpox, and the longest \\nchain of infected individuals is around 6 patients [ 33 ]. \\n6. Treatment \\nThere is no specific treatment for MPX as to date [ 12 ]. CDC \\nrecommends administering the smallpox vaccine within 4 days of \\nexposure which may prevent the disease from happening, and within 2 \\nweeks to reduce symptoms severity [ 12 ]. In immunocompromised pa -\\ntients, first and second generations smallpox vaccines are contradictive, \\nand are replaced with vaccinia immune globulin [ 32 ]. FDA approved \\nSmallpox antivirals tecovirimat and brincidofovir can be used to treat \\nMPX but there are no studies that prove their efficacy [ 12 , 32 ]. Other \\nantivirals that show promise are Cidofovir, CMX-001, and ST-246 [ 33 ]. \\nIn conclusion, we should ask whether the virus has developed new \\nproperties that allow it to spread rapidly, and we should reconsider the \\ndecision to discontinue the national smallpox vaccination programs in \\nmany countries.

It is caused by infection with a protozoan \\nparasite called Trichomonas vaginalis. Although symptoms of the disease vary, most people who have the parasite cannot tell \\nthey are infected. \\nHow common is trichomoniasis? \\nTrichomoniasis is the most common curable STD. In the United States, an estimated 3.7 million people have the infection. \\nHowever, only about 30% develop any symptoms of trichomoniasis. Infection is more common in women than in men. Older \\nwomen are more likely than younger women to have been infected with trichomoniasis.\\nHow do people get trichomoniasis? \\nThe parasite passes from an infected person to an uninfected person during sex. In women, the most commonly infected part \\nof the body is the lower genital tract (vulva, vagina, cervix, or urethra). In men, the most commonly infected body part is the \\ninside of the penis (urethra). During sex, the parasite usually spreads from a penis to a vagina, or from a vagina to a penis. It can \\nalso spread from a vagina to another vagina. It is not common for the parasite to infect other body parts, like the hands, mouth, \\nor anus. It is unclear why some people with the infection get symptoms while others do not. It probably depends on factors \\nlike a person’s age and overall health. Infected people without symptoms can still pass the infection on to others.\\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of trichomoniasis?\\nAbout 70% of infected people do not have any signs or symptoms. When trichomoniasis does cause symptoms, they can range \\nfrom mild irritation to severe inflammation. Some people with symptoms get them within 5 to 28 days after being infected. \\nOthers do not develop symptoms until much later. Symptoms can come and go.\\nMen with trichomoniasis may notice:\\n • Itching or irritation inside the penis;\\n • Burning after urination or ejaculation;\\n • Discharge from the penis.\\nWomen with trichomoniasis may notice:\\n • Itching, burning, redness or soreness of the genitals;\\n • Discomfort with urination;\\n • A change in their vaginal discharge (i.e., thin discharge or increased volume) that can be clear, white, yellowish, or \\ngreenish with an unusual fishy smell.\\nHaving trichomoniasis can make it feel unpleasant to have sex. Without treatment, the infection can last for months or  \\neven years.\\nNational Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention \\nDivision of STD Prevention'),\n",

For example, trichomoniasis can cause genital inflammation \\nthat makes it easier to get infected with HIV, or to pass the HIV virus on to a  \\nsex partner. \\nHow does trichomoniasis affect a pregnant woman and her baby?\\nPregnant women with trichomoniasis are more likely to have their babies too early \\n(preterm delivery). Also, babies born to infected mothers are more likely to have a \\nlow birth weight (less than 5.5 pounds).\\nHow is trichomoniasis diagnosed?\\nIt is not possible to diagnose trichomoniasis based on symptoms alone. For both \\nmen and women, your health care provider can examine you and get a laboratory \\ntest to diagnose trichomoniasis.\\nWhat is the treatment for trichomoniasis?\\nTrichomoniasis can be treated with medication (either metronidazole or tinidazole). \\nThese pills are taken by mouth. It is safe for pregnant women to take this medication. \\nIt is not recommended to drink alcohol within 24 hours after taking this medication.\\nPeople who have been treated for trichomoniasis can get it again. About 1 in 5 \\npeople get infected again within 3 months after receiving treatment. To avoid \\ngetting reinfected, make sure that all of your sex partners get treated. Also, wait 7- 10 \\ndays after you and your partner have been treated to have sex again. Get checked \\nagain if your symptoms come back.\\nHow can trichomoniasis be prevented?\\nThe only way to avoid STDs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.\\nIf you are sexually active, you can do the following things to lower your chances of \\ngetting trichomoniasis:\\n • Be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has \\nbeen tested and has negative STD test results;\\n • Use latex condoms the right way every time you have sex. This can lower your \\nchances of getting trichomoniasis. But the parasite can infect areas that are not \\ncovered by a condom - so condoms may not fully protect you from  \\ngetting trichomoniasis.\\nAnother approach is to talk about the potential risk of STDs before you have sex with \\na new partner. That way you can make informed choices about the level of risk you \\nare comfortable taking with your sex life.\\nIf you or someone you know has questions about trichomoniasis or any other STD, \\ntalk to a health care provider.\\nWhere can I get more \\ninformation?\\nDivision of STD Prevention \\n(DSTDP) \\nCenters for Disease Control and \\nPrevention \\nwww.cdc.gov/std \\nCDC-INFO Contact Center  \\n1-800-CDC-INFO  \\n(1-800-232-4636) \\nhttps://wwwn.cdc.gov/dcs/\\nContactUs/Form \\n \\nCDC National Prevention \\nInformation Network (NPIN) \\nhttps://npin.cdc.gov/disease/stds \\nP .O.

In 2019, 139 389 cases of chlamydia and 35 443 cases \\nof gonorrhea were reported in Canada, an increase of 33.1% and \\n181.7%, respectively, since 2010. 2 These increases may reflect \\nimproved diagnostics, increased screening and contact tracing \\nor a true increase in incidence.2\\nSexually transmitted infections have a substantial impact on \\naffected individuals and communities. Chlamydia trachomatis  \\nand N. gonorrhoeae are commonly implicated pathogens in pelvic \\ninflammatory disease and, if untreated, can lead to infertility. 3 \\nInfection with a bacterial STI is associated with increased risk of \\nHIV acquisition or transmission. 4 Perinatal transmission of C.\\xa0tra-\\nchomatis and N. gonorrhoeae can lead to ophthalmia neonatorum \\nin infants, among other pathologies. 5 Treatment has become \\nmore challenging, given the increase in antimicrobial resistance \\nin gonorrhea.6\\nWe summarize the management of chlamydia and gonorrhea \\nin primary care as health care providers work collectively toward \\nthe goal of decreasing the frequency of these infections and \\nreducing associated morbidity through appropriate treatment. \\nWe draw on evidence from clinical practice guidelines, system-\\natic reviews and meta-analyses (Box 1).\\nWhy is taking a good sexual history \\nimportant?\\nTaking a sexual history is essential to comprehensive care in \\npatients presenting with STI symptoms and in asymptomatic \\npeople to assess for STI risk, determine the need for screening, \\naddress concerns and provide sexual health education.\\nPatients have reported wanting their health care provider \\nto inquire about sexual health, but many face considerable \\nbarriers to self-disclosure of their sexual history. 7,8 Stigma is \\noften associated with STIs. Providers conducting a sexual hist-\\nory should do so in a nonjudgmental, patient-centred and \\ntrauma-informed manner. 9 Syndemics theory describes how \\ndisease interacts with social constructs, which can help con-\\nceptualize how a person’s unique social, cultural and health \\ncontext influences how they access STI care. 10 Establishing the \\npatient’s pronouns, sexual orientation and gender identity is \\nnecessary to create an environment of respect and trust. The \\ncomponents of a sexual history can be remembered by the \\n5\\xa0 Ps: partners, practices, protection, past history and preg-\\nnancy (Table 1). 11\\nReview    CPD\\nA practical approach to the diagnosis and \\nmanagement of chlamydia and gonorrhea\\nClara E.

The clinical \\npresentations of chlamydia and gonorrhea overlap, and they are \\nusually clinically indistinguishable.\\nGenital symptoms\\nUrethritis is the most common syndrome in patients with a penis \\nwho are symptomatic. It is characterized by dysuria, urethral \\npruritis and discharge. Most cases of infectious urethritis are \\ncaused by C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae or both. However, \\nin almost half of cases of nongonococcal urethritis, no specific \\norganism is identified despite extensive microbiological investi -\\ngation (Box 2).14\\nPatients can develop acute epididymitis from chlamydia or \\ngonorrhea, which is characterized by unilateral, posterior tes-\\nticular pain and swelling, often accompanied by symptoms of \\nurethritis. Among men younger than 35 years, C. trachomatis  \\nand N. gonorrhoeae are the most common causative organisms, \\nbut among older men and men who engage in insertive anal \\nintercourse, causative agents can include enteric organisms \\nlike Escherichia coli. 15\\nAlthough cervicitis is often asymptomatic, symptoms may \\noccur and include abnormal vaginal discharge or inter-\\nmenstrual bleeding. 16  Findings on physical examination \\ninclude purulent endocervical discharge or sustained endo -\\ncervical bleeding. Most cases of cervicitis have no identified \\ncause. In as many as 25% of cases, C. trachomatis or N. gonor-\\nrhoeae is identified. 17 In around 15% of female patients, pelvic \\ninflammatory disease can develop, characterized by abdom-\\ninal or pelvic pain, dyspareunia or abnormal uterine bleeding, \\nwith findings of cervical motion or adnexal tenderness on \\nphysical examination. 18 Patients may have infertility as a con-\\nsequence of pelvic inflammatory disease. An uncommon com-\\nplication of pelvic inflammatory disease is Fitz–Hugh–Curtis \\nsyndrome, characterized by right upper quadrant pain related \\nto inflammation of the liver capsule. 17\\nExtragenital symptoms\\nProctitis caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea may present with \\ntenesmus, anorectal pain, bleeding and mucopurulent dis-\\ncharge. These infections typically occur in patients who \\nengage in receptive anal sex, but can also be transmitted \\nfrom the vagina to the anal canal. 19 Chlamydia trachomatis  \\nTable 1: Approach to taking a sexual history*11\\nArea Examples of questions\\nPartners • Are you currently having sex of any kind?\\n• In the last 2 months, how many sexual partners have you had?\\n• What is/are the genders of your sexual partners?\\n• Do your partners have other sexual partners?

Lymphogranuloma venereum can \\npresent as small painless ulcers or painful hemorrhagic proct-\\nitis, with complications including anal fistulae and strictures. 21 \\nIn the last 2 decades, LGV has emerged as an important cause of \\nproctitis among men who have sex with men (MSM) in North \\nAmerica and Europe. 22\\nOropharyngeal infections with gonorrhea are commonly \\nasymptomatic, although patients can present with sore throat, \\npharyngeal exudate or cervical lymphadenitis. 23 Chlamydia is not \\nan important cause of pharyngitis. 24\\nAlthough uncommon, gonorrhea infection can cause bacter-\\nemia, leading to septic arthritis or disseminated gonococcal \\ninfection, with tenosynovitis, dermatitis or polyarthralgias. 23 \\nReactive arthritis — characterized by polyarthritis, conjunctivitis \\nor uveitis, and urethritis or cervicitis — can occur after an infec-\\ntion with chlamydia or gonorrhea, although chlamydia is the \\nmore common inciting infection. 25\\nWho should be screened for infection?\\nOpportunistic screening is critical in identifying asymptomatic \\nchlamydia and gonorrhea infections. The Canadian Task Force \\non Preventive Health Care recommends annual opportunistic \\nscreening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in all sexually active \\npeople younger than 30 years. 26 Although based on low-quality \\nevidence, an opportunistic approach to screening is likely to \\nincrease the number of STIs diagnosed and destigmatize sexual \\nhealth conversations.\\nMore frequent screening should be offered to people at \\nhigher risk of acquiring STIs, although little evidence exists to \\nguide the optimal frequency of screening. Among MSM, current \\nguidance suggests, at minimum, anatomic site-based screening \\nfor chlamydia and gonorrhea annually. 13,24 More frequent \\nscreening (i.e., every 3–6 months) is recommended for at-risk \\npeople of any gender within groups who may be disproportion-\\nately affected by STIs, including those taking HIV pre-exposure \\nprophylaxis (PrEP), those who have recently had an STI, those \\nliving with HIV or those with multiple sexual partners. 13,24,27 One \\ncohort study of 557 MSM and transgender women taking HIV \\nPrEP found that semiannual STI screening would have led to \\ndelayed diagnosis in more than 30% of patients with chlamydia \\nor gonorrhea, compared with quarterly screening. 28 Pregnant \\npatients should be screened at their first prenatal visit, with \\nrescreening in the third trimester if they initially test positive for \\nor are at ongoing risk of STIs. 13,24\\nClinicians should determine appropriate anatomic sites for \\nscreening based on information from the sexual history, \\nalthough they should consider screening extragenital sites (i.e., \\nrectum and oropharynx), even in the absence of either reported \\nsymptoms or sexual exposures. Studies of people attending STI \\nclinics have found that a considerable proportion of STIs are \\nmissed when STI testing is conducted only for patients with \\nreported symptoms or on sites with known exposure, or when \\ntesting includes only urine. 29,30 Testing for gender-diverse \\npatients will depend on their specific anatomy.\\nHow should patients be tested?\\nIn asymptomatic patients, approaches to sample collection for \\nnucleic acid amplication testing (NAAT) for chlamydia and gon-\\norrhea include a first-void urine (first 10–20 mL, any time of \\nday, at least 1 hour since previous void) or vaginal swab; other \\noptions include a urethral or cervical swab (Table 2). In patients \\nwith a vagina, a vaginal swab is preferred over first-void urine, \\nas urine testing may detect 10% fewer infections. 31 Those with a \\nneovagina or gender-affirming penile reconstruction should \\nprovide a urine sample for NAAT. Extragenital testing options \\ninclude a pharyngeal or rectal swab for chlamydia and gonor-\\nrhea NAAT. In symptomatic patients, first-void urine and swabs \\nof sites of reported symptoms should be collected for chla-\\nmydia and gonorrhea NAAT, and for gonorrhea culture and sen-\\nsitivity testing. Patient-collected swabs are acceptable, as stud-\\nies have shown equivalence between self- and clinician-collected \\noral, vaginal and rectal swabs for chlamydia and gonorrhea \\nBox 2: Infectious differential diagnosis of common \\nclinical presentations of sexually transmitted \\ninfections\\nUrethritis\\n• Neisseria gonorrhoeae\\n• Chlamydia trachomatis\\n• Mycoplasma genitalium\\n• Trichomonas vaginalis\\n• Neisseria meningitidis\\n• Hemophilus spp.\\n• Herpes simplex virus\\n• Adenovirus\\nCervicitis\\n• Chlamydia trachomatis\\n• Neisseria gonorrhoeae\\n• Trichomoniasis\\n• Herpes simplex virus\\n• Mycoplasma genitalium\\n• Bacterial vaginosis\\nProctitis\\n• Neisseria gonorrhoeae\\n• Chlamydia trachomatis (including lymphogranuloma \\nvenereum serovars)\\n• Syphilis\\n• Herpes simplex virus\\n• Mpox virus\\nEpididymitis\\n• Neisseria gonorrhoeae\\n• Chlamydia trachomatis\\n• Enteric organisms (e.g., Escherichia coli)'),\n",

First-void urine can be collected in a \\nsterile urine container for chlamydia and gonorrhea NAAT. \\nThe swabs contained within chlamydia and gonorrhea NAAT \\nkits can be used on the cervix, urethra, vagina, throat or rec-\\ntum; swabs from these sites can also be sent for gonorrhea \\nculture. Bacterial culture for chlamydia is not routinely per-\\nformed in Canada. 13\\nGenotyping of LGV serovars can be requested if a patient \\npresents with a syndrome consistent with LGV. 13 Some Canadian \\njurisdictions will automatically test all positive rectal chlamydia \\nswabs for LGV serovars. However, it is important to indicate \\nsuspicion for LGV on laboratory requisitions, as automatic LGV \\ntesting is not universal, and nonrectal specimens (e.g., genital \\nulcers) are not automatically tested.\\nHow should patients be treated?\\nGonorrhea\\nTreatment of gonorrhea is challenging, as it readily develops \\nantimicrobial resistance, and guidelines are not congruent in \\ntheir recommendations. The Canadian STI guideline recom-\\nmends dual therapy with ceftriaxone or cefixime, plus azithro-\\nmycin or doxycycline (Table 3). 13 The STI treatment guideline \\nfrom the United States Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\\ntion (CDC) increased the previously recommended ceftriaxone \\ndose (Table\\xa03). 24 The CDC also recommended against dual ther-\\napy based on increasing antimicrobial resistance, and concern \\nfor impacts on the microbiome and selective pressure on other \\npathogens. 24 It is likely that this approach will be adopted by \\nguidelines from other jurisdictions in the future. If monother-\\napy with ceftriaxone is used, an increased dose of ceftriaxone \\nis recommended, compared with that used in dual therapy \\n(Table 3). 24 Currently, given varying recommendations, clin-\\nicians should follow local guidance, which will be based on \\nresistance patterns in their area.\\nChlamydia\\nThe Canadian STI guideline recommends doxycycline or azithro-\\nmycin as the first-line (preferred) treatment for chlamydia, 13 \\nwhereas the CDC recommends doxycycline as first-line treat-\\nment, with azithromycin as a second-line (alternate) regimen  \\n(Table 3).24 The preference for doxycycline is based on a system-\\natic review and meta-analysis comparing treatment with azithro-\\nmycin and doxycycline for chlamydia, which found that treat-\\nment failed more often with azithromycin, particularly among \\nmen with rectal chlamydia. 34,35 Thus, doxycycline is the preferred \\nagent for treating rectal chlamydia. If adherence to therapy is a \\nconcern, single-dose azithromycin may be preferred. For preg-\\nnant patients, azithromycin is the first-line treatment. 13 For \\npatients with suspected or confirmed LGV, treatment with doxy-\\ncycline should be continued for 21 days.13\\nOther treatment considerations\\nGiven the potential complexity of cases and the evolving treat-\\nment landscape, providers should consult with an expert in \\nSTI management when necessary. All patients being treated \\nfor chlamydia or gonorrhea should be strongly advised to \\nabstain from sexual activity for 7 days after treatment and \\nuntil all partners have been treated. 13 Sexual partners from \\nthe previous 60 days should be tested and treated, or offered \\nexpedited partner treatment (i.e., clinicians can provide \\nempiric treatment for the patient to give to their partner), \\nwhich has been found to reduce the rates of recurrent or per-\\nsistent infection. 36 Details around indications and timing of \\ntests of cure are discussed in Table 3. Tests of cure and repeat \\nscreening recommendations are often not followed, although \\nthey remain important for the appropriate care of the patient \\nand to decrease transmission. 37\\nTable 2: Testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea\\nSite\\nApproach for asymptomatic patients or \\nscreening Approach for symptomatic patients\\nPenile urethra • First-void urine for NAAT for chlamydia \\nand gonorrhea\\n• Urethral swab for gonorrhea culture and sensitivity testing, and first-void \\nurine for NAAT for chlamydia and gonorrhea\\nCervix or vagina* • Vaginal swab (preferred), cervical swab \\nor first-void urine for NAAT for chlamydia \\nand gonorrhea\\n• Cervical swab for gonorrhea culture and sensitivity testing, and for NAAT for \\nchlamydia and gonorrhea, or\\n• Vaginal swab for gonorrhea culture and sensitivity testing, and for NAAT for \\nchlamydia and gonorrhea, or\\n• First-void urine for NAAT for chlamydia and gonorrhea \\nThroat • Throat swab for NAAT for chlamydia and \\ngonorrhea\\n• Throat swab for gonorrhea culture and sensitivity testing, and for NAAT for \\nchlamydia and gonorrhea\\nRectum • Rectal swab for NAAT for chlamydia and \\ngonorrhea\\n• Rectal swab for gonorrhea culture and sensitivity testing, and for NAAT for \\nchlamydia and gonorrhea\\nNote: NAAT = nucleic acid amplification test.\\n*For patients with a neovagina, a first-void urine is the preferred screening test.

There are different signs and \\nsymptoms associated with each stage.\\nHow is syphilis spread?\\nYou can get syphilis by direct contact with a syphilis sore during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. You can find \\nsores on or around the penis, vagina, or anus. You can also find them in the rectum, on the lips, or in \\nthe mouth. Syphilis can spread from an infected mother to her unborn baby.\\nWhat does syphilis look like?\\nSyphilis is divided into stages (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary), with different signs and \\nsymptoms associated with each stage. A person with primary syphilis generally has a sore or sores at \\nthe original site of infection. These sores usually occur on or around the genitals, around the anus or in \\nthe rectum, or in or around the mouth. These sores are usually (but not always) firm, round, and \\npainless. Symptoms of secondary syphilis include skin rash, swollen lymph nodes, and fever. The signs \\nand symptoms of primary and secondary syphilis can be mild, and they might not be noticed.

Have an honest and open talk with your health care provider Example of a primary syphilis sore. \\nand ask whether you should be tested for syphilis or other STDs. \\n• All pregnant women should be tested for syphilis at their first prenatal visit.\\n• You should get tested regularly for syphilis if you are sexually active and\\no are a man who has sex with men;\\no are living with HIV; or\\no have partner(s) who have tested positive for syphilis.\\nI’m pregnant. How does syphilis affect my baby?\\nIf you are pregnant and have syphilis, you can give the infection to your unborn baby. Having syphilis \\ncan lead to a low birth weight baby. It can also make it more likely you will deliver your baby too early \\nor stillborn (a baby born dead). To protect your baby, you should be tested for syphilis at least \\nonce during your pregnancy. Receive immediate treatment if you test positive.\\nAn infec\\nted baby may be born without signs or symptoms of disease. However, if not treated immediately, \\nthe baby may develop serious problems within a few weeks. Untreated babies can have health problems \\nsuch as cataracts, deafness, or seizures, and can die.\\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of syphilis?\\nSymptoms of syphilis in adults vary by stage:\\nPrimary Stage\\nDuring the first (primary) stage of syphilis, you may notice a single sore or \\nmultiple sores. The sore is the location where syphilis entered your body.  \\nSores are usually (but not always) firm, round, and painless. Because the sore \\nis painless, it can easily go unnoticed. The sore usually lasts 3 to 6 weeks and \\nheals regardless of whether or not you receive treatment. Even after the \\nSecondary rash from syphilis on  \\npalms of hands. \\nSecondary rash from syphilis  \\non torso. \\nSecondary Stage\\nDuring the secondary stage, you may have skin rashes and/or mucous \\nmembrane lesions. Mucous membrane lesions are sores in your mouth, vagina, \\nor anus. This stage usually starts with a rash on one or more areas of your body. \\nThe rash can show up when your primary sore is healing or several weeks after \\nthe sore has healed. The rash can look like rough, red, or reddish brown spots \\non the palms of your hands and/or the bottoms of your feet. The rash usually \\nwon’t itch and it is sometimes so faint that you won’t notice it. Other symptoms \\nyou may have can include fever, swollen lymph glands, sore throat, patchy hair \\nloss, headaches, weight loss, muscle aches, and fatigue (feeling very tired). The  \\nsore goes away, you must still receive treatment. \\nThis will stop your infection from moving to the \\nsecondary stage.'),\n",

Muzny, MD, MSPH, and Olivia T. Van Gerwen, MD, MPH\\nABSTRACT\\nIntroduction: Secnidazole (SEC), newly FDA-approved for trichomoniasis, is a potent 5-nitroimidazole with\\nselective toxicity against various infections. It has been used internationally to treat trichomoniasis, bacterial vagi-\\nnosis, and other infections for decades. Trichomoniasis is the most common non−viral sexually transmitted\\ninfection worldwide and is associated with signiﬁcant morbidity. In comparison to the only other approved treat-\\nments for trichomoniasis in the U.S.—metronidazole and tinidazole—SEC has favorable pharmacokinetics,\\nincluding a longer half-life, and a lower minimal lethal concentration againstTrichomonas vaginalis.\\nObjectives: Provide an updated, comprehensive review of the literature evaluating SEC as a treatment for tricho-\\nmoniasis in women and men.\\nMethods: We conducted a search to identify existing research on SEC and trichomoniasis. On August 6, 2021,\\nwe searched MEDLINE using the terms“secnidazole” and “trichomon.*” We excluded reviews, editorials, case\\nreports, and small case series.\\nResults: We identiﬁed 29 articles; 14 of which were included: 5 reported in vitro pharmacologic data on SEC, 6\\nwere observational studies, and 4 were controlled clinical trials (1 observational study also reported in vitro phar-\\nmacologic data). Six studies reported data on women only, 1 on men only, and 3 on women and men. These\\nstudies showed that SEC—as a single dose or 3-day course—had comparable efﬁcacy to multi-dose metronida-\\nzole for treating trichomoniasis in women and men, was generally well tolerated by patients, and had a favorable\\npharmacokinetic proﬁle. A single 2-g dose of SEC also led to a microbiologic cure rate of 92.2% in theﬁrst ran-\\ndomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of trichomonas-infected US-based women.\\nConclusion: SEC is an efﬁcacious and safe treatment for women and men with trichomoniasis.

Subgroup analyses\\nof women with HIV, BV, or vaginal symptoms at baseline\\nshowed cure rates of 100%, 92.9%, and 95.2%, respectively,\\nafter treatment with SEC.24 No matching patients in the placebo\\ngroup had a negative T. vaginalis culture at TOC (all P <\\n0.001).24 SEC was generally well tolerated. The most frequent\\nadverse events were vulvovaginal candidiasis and nausea (each\\n2.7%) and no serious adverse events were observed.\\nDISCUSSION\\nIn reviewing data on SEC for the treatment of trichomoniasis,\\nwe found the efﬁcacy of SEC, given as a single oral dose or a 3-\\nday course, was comparable to multi-dose MTZ or a single dose\\nof Mentha crispa. MTZ was approved in the early 1960s to treat\\ntrichomoniasis and is the current standard of care.46 Only one\\nstudy has been conducted onMentha crispa for the treatment of\\ntrichomoniasis, and it is not currently a recommended or rou-\\ntinely used treatment in the U.S. Cure rates for SEC—symptom-\\natic cure, microbiologic, and both—were high for all studies,\\nwith rates following single-dose regimens ranging from 92.2\\n−100%. Overall, SEC had a favorable safety proﬁle, as the\\noccurrence of individual adverse events was≤10% in all but one\\nstudy32 (50.0% metallic taste and 16.7% nausea). SEC also has\\npotentially advantageous PK attributes, including a substantially\\nlonger half-life than other 5-nitroimidazoles, as well as lower\\nMLC and similar MIC and MTC compared to MTZ.\\nBased in part on the supportiveﬁndings of the aforementioned\\n2021 U.S. randomized trial,24 SEC was approved by the FDA for\\nthe treatment for adults with trichomoniasis as a single 2-g oral\\ndose on June 30, 2021.44,47 SEC has also been an FDA-approved\\ntreatment for women with BV since 2017, and the new supple-\\nmental indication makes SEC the only single-dose oral medica-\\ntion on the market for both trichomoniasis, and BV.24,47\\nFor the treatment of trichomoniasis, the 2020 American Col-\\nlege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Clinical Man-\\nagement Guidelines and 2021 CDC STI Treatment Guidelines\\nnow recommend MTZ 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days in\\nall T. vaginalis/C0 infected women, or alternatively, TDZ oral 2-g\\nsingle dose.1,5 In men, the CDC recommends MTZ 2-g single\\ndose or alternatively, TDZ oral 2-g single dose.1 However, it\\nmust be noted that both sets of updated guidelines were released\\nbefore our study24 was published, and prior to SEC being FDA-\\napproved for treatment of trichomoniasis.\\nTherefore, although SEC is not currently included in the\\n2021 CDC STI Treatment Guidelines or ACOG 2020 Guide-\\nlines for trichomoniasis, we believe theﬁndings of this review\\ndemonstrate that it could represent an additional treatment\\noption to those currently recommended for trichomoniasis. In\\nthe limited comparative data identiﬁed in this review SEC per-\\nformed as good as or better than multi-dose MTZ in curing\\ntrichomoniasis, and both drugs were similarly well tolerated by\\npatients. However, there are no studies directly comparing SEC\\nto multi-dose MTZ, which is an important area of future\\nresearch. It should be noted that the studies used to support the\\nguideline changes and evaluate the MTZ 2-g dose vs MTZ\\n500 mg BID 7-day dose were not blinded to patient or investiga-\\ntor.48 The SEC trial,24 although against placebo, was double-\\nblinded, multi-center, and had similar demographics. In terms of\\ntolerability, in the MTZ trial, 33% (multi-dose group) and 34%\\n(single-dose group) of patients experienced≥1 adverse events,48\\nwhile only 15% of patients experienced≥1 adverse events in our\\nrecent trial on SEC.24\\nCurrent guidelines recommend that choice of treatment be\\nbased on patient preference, cost, convenience, adherence, and\\nease of use. As the cost of SEC and other 5-nitroimidazoles varies\\nby region and individual patient and are based upon state Medic-\\naid, insurance coverage, and patient assistance eligibility, the\\nchoice of treatment option for trichomoniasis should be weighed\\nagainst other important mitigating factors. In evaluating cost, it\\nis also appropriate to consider the overall societal cost related to\\nnon−adherence to multi-dose therapies for trichomoniasis. Such\\nsocietal cost burdens include increased visits due to recurrentT.\\nvaginalis infection as well as increased costs related to acquisition\\nand treatment of more signiﬁcant and lifelong disease, including\\nHIV acquisition/transmission as well as other STI acquisition.\\nFinally, there are broader general psychosexual burdens that\\nmake adherence with a single dose option beneﬁcial. Another\\nbeneﬁt of oral SEC is that it is the only single-dose medication\\nthat is also FDA-approved for concurrent BV treatment. SEC is\\nadministered as a single 2-g oral dose for trichomoniasis, which\\nalso may lead to favorable adherence rates in both patients and\\ntheir partners. Poor treatment compliance is recognized as a\\npotential cause of early repeatT. vaginalis infections, and dura-\\ntion of therapy can be a barrier that adversely affects\\nadherence.49,50 Research has shown that adherence to multi-dose\\nantibiotics is low—with one study reporting rates of only 50\\n−63% for patients taking multidose MTZ for BV51,52—and\\ncompliance can worsen as the length of therapy increases. 53\\nAlthough no research has yet been conducted to demonstrate\\nthat single-dose drug regimens are superior to multi-dose regi-\\nmens for trichomoniasis, the single-dose administration of SEC\\ncould potentially improve patient adherence, and thus reduce\\nSecnidazole for Trichomoniasis 259\\nSex Med Rev 2022;10:255−262\\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/smr/article/10/2/255/6880271 by guest on 01 February 2025'),\n",

However, identifying \\nthose at risk of STIs is complicated by stigma associated with STIs, undisclosed risk behaviour, \\nand the fact that STI epidemics are diversifying beyond traditional risk groups typically \\ncharacterised by demographics and sexual behaviours alone. In this review, we describe the \\nepidemiology of STIs among traditional and emerging risk groups, particularly in the context of \\nuptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), increasing STI transmission among heterosexual \\npeople, and the concentration of STI burden among speciﬁc subgroups not readily identiﬁable \\nby health services. Risk diversiﬁcation poses signiﬁcant challenges, not only for risk-based \\ntesting, but also for the costs and resources required to reach a broader range of constituents \\nwith preventive and health promotion interventions. As drivers of STI risk are not purely \\nbehavioural, but relate to relative STI prevalence within sexual networks and access to sexual \\nhealth care and testing, localised surveillance and research is important in ensuring risk is \\nappropriately understood and addressed within local contexts.

With the majority of acute bacterial STIs being asymptomatic, identifying groups \\nmost at risk of infection is important for prioritising screening, targeting prevention \\nstrategies and alleviating the burden of STIs. Not adequately identifying people at high \\nrisk of STIs can limit the eﬀectiveness of preventive interventions and lead to unnecessary \\ntesting and health-systems costs.

The World \\nHealth Organization’s (WHO) global health sector strategy on \\nSTIs suggests that each country needs to ‘deﬁne the speciﬁc \\npopulations that are most aﬀected by STI epidemics’ and \\nthat their response should be ‘based on epidemiological \\nand social context’.1 These key populations are broadly \\ncategorised based on demographics such as gender and age, \\nand speciﬁc sexual behaviours, such as number and gender \\nof sexual partners. Speciﬁc populations that are highlighted \\nin WHO guidance include adolescents and young people, \\nmen who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people, \\nsex workers, and people who use drugs. \\nAdolescents \\nAlthough young people and adolescents have been long \\nrecognised as a priority population for STIs,2 targeted \\napproaches are challenged by the fact they represent a \\nsubstantial percentage of the general population and a \\nbehaviourally heterogeneous group. An analysis of data from \\nthe Global Burden of Diseases study found that adolescents \\nhave a higher STI burden than other age groups, and \\nalthough overall the age-standardised incidence rate of STIs \\nis trending down globally, the actual number of incident \\ninfections is increasing, likely due to the growth in the \\nsexually active population and an increasing number of \\ninfections in adolescents.3 Although there are biological \\nfactors which increase risk (e.g. young females can be more \\nsusceptible to chlamydia and HPV due to lower production \\nof cervical mucous and increased cervical ectopy4), key \\ndrivers of risk among young people and adolescents include \\nsimultaneously being more likely to engage in sexual risk \\nbehaviour (e.g. concurrent partners and condomless sex)2 \\nand less likely to access sexual health services.5 Low rates of \\nseeking sexual health care among adolescents are likely, in \\npart, to be associated with concerns about conﬁdentiality \\nand discomfort in discussing sexual health concerns, as well \\nas lack of knowledge about available services.6 Typically \\nlower rates of general health-seeking behaviours among \\nmales drive lower rates of STI screening in general practice,7 \\nwith testing among heterosexual males more likely to be \\ndriven by symptomatic presentation or partner notiﬁcation.8 \\nTrends in STI diagnoses among young people are dynamic \\nand ﬂuctuate across many settings. A recent analysis of data \\nfrom the US found that among the youngest group, those \\naged 12–17 years, chlamydia and gonorrhoea positivity \\ndecreased, whereas it increased for the other age groups.9 \\nInsights garnered from behavioural epidemiology data can \\nbe used to understand such changes and also guide priorities \\nfor risk-based screening and other interventions. In this \\nstudy, the authors suggest decreasing positivity among those \\naged 12–17 years may be associated with a declining propor-\\ntion of high school students who report ever having sex, having \\nfallen from 47.4% in 2011 to 39.5% in 2017.10 In contrast, \\nrepeated behavioural surveillance of high school students in \\nAustralia found the proportion of students reporting ever \\nhaving penetrative sex increased from 34.7% in 2002 to \\n46.6% in 2018.11 As routine presentation to primary care \\nremains the main access point to the healthcare system for \\nmany young people, opportunistic STI screening relies on \\nclinicians being comfortable asking young people about sex \\nand sexual risk, and creating ‘safe’ clinical environments where \\nyoung people feel comfortable discussing and disclosing \\ninformation about sexual practices. \\nHeterosexuals \\nAlthough MSM in high-income countries carry a signiﬁcant \\nburden of STIs, there is evidence that prevalence of STIs is \\nincreasing among heterosexual populations. For example, \\nalthough gonorrhoea has been historically concentrated \\namong MSM in Australia,12 there has been a 475% increase \\nin gonorrhoea notiﬁcations among females in the state of \\nVictoria, Australia, from 2010 to 2019.13,14 Similarly, whereas \\nsyphilis diagnoses in Australia remains concentrated among \\nMSM residing in inner urban locations, syphilis is increas-\\ning in heterosexual men and women in Australia, especially \\nthose residing outside of inner-city suburbs.15 Although the \\nreasons for STI increases among heterosexuals in outer-\\nsuburbs are not fully understood, they may be reﬂective \\nof less access of sexual health services.14 Australian HIV \\nsurveillance data shows that, for HIV, women are often \\ndiagnosed late and report no prior history of HIV testing.16 \\nGenomic analyses also suggest that transmission of gonorrhoea \\ninto heterosexual populations may be facilitated through the \\nbridging of sexual networks via populations of men who \\nhave sex with men and women.17 \\nFurther, although the burden of STIs among young \\nheterosexuals has been well described, more evidence is \\ncoming to light of emergent STI epidemics among older \\nheterosexual populations. In the US, the Centers for Disease \\nControl and Prevention (CDC) reports a doubling of STIs \\namong those aged >65 over the last 10 years.18 Reasons for \\nincreasing STI rates among older populations may relate to \\nlower levels of sexual health knowledge19 and inaccurate \\nrisk perception20 among older generations. \\nMen who have sex with men \\nAlthough STI epidemics may be diversifying beyond \\ntraditional risk groups, STI burden remains clustered within \\nnetworks of people who may share speciﬁc risk practices \\n266'),\n",

MSM are at \\nincreased risk of STIs due to a combination of biological and \\nbehavioural factors (e.g. more partners, more concurrent \\npartners, type of partners) and the relative prevalence of \\nSTIs within sexual networks that contributes transmission \\nrisk. Although MSM are recognised as a priority group for \\nSTIs globally, the population of MSM comprises a diverse \\ngroup, with diﬀerent behaviours, identities and healthcare \\nneeds, and consequently risk varies across speciﬁc subgroups. \\nFor example, MSM living with HIV have historically had \\nhigher rates of STIs such as syphilis21 and sexually acquired \\nhepatitis C,22 likely associated with smaller sexual networks \\nwith high rates of partner mixing, which sustain high \\nprevalence and onward transmission. Given the often diﬀer-\\ning prevalence of STIs between HIV-negative MSM and \\nMSM living with HIV, and speciﬁc sexual network \\ndynamics, behavioural and demographic predictors of STI \\nrisk often vary between the two groups.23 Further, rates of \\nspeciﬁc STIs within risk populations often vary based on \\nage. For example, among MSM in Australia, gonorrhoea \\nis more common among those aged 20–29 years compared \\nto syphilis, which is most common among those aged \\n30–39 years.24 \\nThe concentration of STI risk among subgroups of MSM is \\nalso diversifying. Advances in biomedical interventions for \\nHIV over the past decade, including Treatment as Prevention \\n(TasP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), have led to \\nchanges in behaviour and STI epidemiology among MSM. \\nAlthough declines in condom use at the population25,26 and \\nindividual level27–29 associated with the roll-out of PrEP in \\nhigh-income countries have occurred in parallel to increases \\nin STI incidence,30,31 disentangling and quantifying the direct \\neﬀect of PrEP rollout on STI incidence is diﬃcult.32 Some \\ncountries that have seen signiﬁcant uptake of PrEP were \\nobserving increases in STIs and declines in condom use \\namong MSM prior to this scale-up.33 Even prior to \\nepidemiological evidence emerging, assumptions regarding \\ndeclines in condom use in the context of PrEP has led to \\nspeciﬁc STI testing guidelines for PrEP delivery.34 STI \\ntesting guidelines for PrEP also acknowledge the risk-based \\ncriteria for PrEP prescribing35–37 and high rates of STI \\ndiagnosis prior to PrEP initiation.30,38 Surveillance data \\nfrom Australia, where PrEP has been available since early \\n2016 through large demonstration projects39,40 and more \\nwidely available since April 2018 when PrEP was approved \\nas a government subsidised medicine, have shown that, \\nalthough rates of chlamydia and gonorrhoea have stabilised \\namong MSM using PrEP, syphilis continues to increase.41 \\nContinuing increases in syphilis among PrEP users is likely \\nreﬂective of greater comfort in,42 and increased rates of,43 \\nserodiscordant sex in the era of HIV TasP and PrEP, and the \\ngreater diﬀerential in syphilis prevalence between MSM \\nliving with HIV and HIV-negative MSM compared to \\nchlamydia and gonorrhoea. Further still, within risk groups \\nsuch as PrEP users, the burden of STIs is highly skewed \\ntowards those experiencing repeat or concurrent infections. \\nAnalysis of PrEP users enrolled in an early demonstration \\nproject in Australia found that 50% of PrEP users were not \\ndiagnosed with an STI during follow up, and that one-\\nquarter of PrEP users accounted for three-quarters of STIs.30 \\nThese trends have continued to be observed into the years \\nfollowing widespread PrEP implementation in Australia41 \\nand in other settings such as the UK.44 \\nTravellers and migration \\nWith early detection and treatment of STIs to prevent onwards \\ntransmission a key STI prevention strategy, there is an \\nincreasing focus on the impact of higher risk behaviours and \\nsettings associated with international travel and migration on \\nlocal STI transmission. International travellers returning from \\nhigh-prevalence settings are at increased risk of STIs,45 and if \\nnot identiﬁed upon arrival, risk introducing new strains of \\nSTIs and seeding new clusters of transmission. Pre-emptive \\nsexual risk screening during clinical visits prior to travel, \\nfor example for vaccines, could provide an opportunity to \\noﬀer STI interventions, such as STI immunisation, PrEP or \\nself-initiated antibiotic treatment of bacterial STIs, while \\nalso prompting travellers to be screened for STIs when they \\nreturn.46 \\nMigrants arriving in high-income countries often face \\nadditional barriers to accessing sexual health care driven \\nby cultural aspects of stigma, knowledge gaps in health \\nliteracy, and ineligibility for subsidised care.47 For example, \\nin Australia, newly arrived Asian-born MSM have been \\nidentiﬁed as an emerging priority group for HIV,48 with \\nqualitative work highlighting that lack of access to subsidised \\nPrEP introduces a cost barrier for many newly-arrived MSM.49 \\nSimilar structural barriers exist for access to routine HIV and \\nother STI testing for this group, which potentially contribute \\nto higher observed incidence of HIV among Asian-born MSM \\nand high rates of testing positive for HIV at ﬁrst presentation \\nfor testing.50 The impact of inequitable access to health care \\non STI risk may be compounded by changes in sexual risk-\\ntaking behaviour following migration, especially among \\nMSM emigrating from countries with typically repressive \\nsocial norms to countries with more progressive views and \\ngreater access to gay venues and community.51 Similarly, \\nmigrant sex workers are often at greater risk of STIs than \\nnon-migrant sex workers, although the interaction between \\nmigrant status and country income level has been shown to \\nvary depending on local epidemiology and legal contexts.52 \\nSTI risk has been shown to be higher among migrant sex \\nworkers who do not have contact with outreach workers,53 \\nfurther highlighting the impact of unequal access to health \\ncare and harm-reduction services on STI risk among migrant \\npopulations.

Stoové Sexual Health \\nmobility likely contributes to high levels of STI prevalence \\namong remote indigenous communities in Australia.54 \\nTechnology and risk environments \\nAcross a diverse range of traditional and non-traditional risk \\ngroups, speciﬁc behaviours may be associated with particular \\nrisk environments or the use of digital technologies to meet \\npartners that pose challenges for risk-based screening in \\nclinics and for targeted interventions and health promotion. \\nFor example, among MSM, meeting partners at sex-on-\\npremises venues may be associated with increased risk, \\nas STI prevalence is high among MSM attending these \\nvenues.55 Meeting partners online or through ‘hookup’ apps \\nhas also been shown to be associated with greater STI risk \\namong MSM.56 For heterosexual people, although a recent \\nreview found no evidence of an association between online-\\npartner seeking and lower condom use or STI status,57 \\namong young heterosexual people, use of geo-social dating \\napps has been linked to increased rates of casual sex, \\nhaving multiple partners and having sex without discussion \\nabout STI status.58 Other subcultural behaviours associated \\nwith increased STI risk, such as ‘swinging’,59 may not be \\nreadily identiﬁed at STI clinics. Practices such as those \\nmentioned above typically cluster within speciﬁc geographic \\nand social or sexual networks, and therefore relative risk can \\nbe temporally and signiﬁcantly elevated in the context of \\nundiagnosed infections entering speciﬁc networks, resulting \\nin outbreaks of STI infections. \\nWith more evidence of diversifying STI risk, there is a need \\nto go beyond broad, risk-group categorisations based on age, \\nsex and sexuality. Risk diversiﬁcation poses signiﬁcant \\nchallenges, not only in terms of risk-based diagnostic testing, \\nbut also in relation to the costs and resources associated with \\nreaching a broader range of constituents with preventive \\nand health promotion interventions. Here, continued STI \\nsurveillance and research, including qualitative and ethno-\\ngraphic research to understand contextual factors that drive \\nrisk, is important and emerging data need to be monitored \\nclosely to guide and inform policy and practice. Early \\ndetection of risk diversiﬁcation is crucial, given STI control \\nbecomes increasingly challenging as prevalence increases in \\nemergent risk populations. Strategies must continue to \\npromote high intervention coverage among known risk \\ngroups, but also consider targeted interventions that focus \\non individuals at greatest risk within these groups. \\nRethinking risk – more than just behaviours \\nAs described above, deﬁning traditional risk groups on \\nthe basis of broad demographic and sexual behaviour may \\nbe inadequate for eﬃcient and eﬀective STI prevention \\nand clinical interventions. To guide targeted interventions \\ntowards those at greatest risk, strategies that include \\nnon-behavioural considerations may be beneﬁcial. For \\nexample, although condom use may be strongly associated \\nwith HIV risk, there is mixed evidence of the association \\nbetween condom use and STI risk, relative to other factors; \\nevidence suggests that among MSM using PrEP, condom \\nuse is less predictive of STI risk than sexual networks and the \\npractices that contribute to deﬁning these networks.30 The \\nestimated per-partner eﬀectiveness of condoms for bacterial \\nSTIs60 is also much lower than for HIV,61,62 and high levels \\nof extra-genital transmission of STIs among MSM have \\nbeen reported.63 Practitioners should therefore consider, \\ndependent upon local epidemiology and context, a broader \\nsuite of factors when screening for risk, beyond traditional \\nnotions of broad demographic risk or condom-based deﬁni-\\ntions of ‘safe sex’. \\nNeighbourhoods and access to health care \\nKey drivers of STI risk are not purely behavioural, but relate to \\nSTI prevalence within respective communities and sexual \\nnetworks, as well as individuals’ access to sexual health care \\nand testing. Less access to testing and health care means that \\nSTIs remain undiagnosed for a long period of time, and \\nindividuals have more chance of passing infections on to \\ntheir sexual partners. This is evident among populations of \\nblack MSM in high-income countries such as the US, the UK \\nand Canada, who are at increased risk of HIV compared to \\nwhite MSM, despite there being no evidence that black \\nMSM have more partners or engage in more serodiscordant \\ncondomless sex than other MSM.64 A wealth of data highlights \\nthat black MSM in the US are often faced with poor access to \\nculturally competent health services, including HIV and \\nSTI testing, and experience stigma and discrimination that \\nimpede access to services.65 Similarly, Aboriginal commu-\\nnities living in remote regions of Australia experience \\ndisproportionately high rates of STIs, with chlamydia and \\ngonorrhoea prevalence among young people in these \\ncommunities among the highest in the world.66,67 With \\nothers demonstrating similar numbers of sexual partners \\nand a similar average age at sexual debut among young \\nAboriginal Australians compared to non-Indigenous young \\npeople,68 discrepancies in STI incidence are likely driven by \\nstructural barriers (e.g. access to testing aﬀecting rates of \\nundiagnosed infections). Despite clinical guidelines and \\nspecialist support for primary healthcare clinicians visiting \\nthese remote communities, rates of re-testing and clinical \\nfollow up within recommended timeframes in Aboriginal \\ncommunities are suboptimal.69 Remote Aboriginal commu-\\nnities are faced with signiﬁcant clinician-level barriers to \\nSTI testing, such as high levels of clinician turnover, a lack \\nof familiarity with STI protocols, and prioirtisation of other \\nurgent health concerns by clinicians.70 The impact of access \\nto health care on HIV outcomes is also reﬂected in Australian \\nmigrant communities, especially those from South-East Asia \\nand Sub-Saharan Africa and those from countries that \\n268'),\n",

For example, early PrEP guidelines in Australia \\nrecommended prescribing PrEP even in the absence \\nof recent risk, if individuals anticipated risky behaviour \\nin the near future.34 Similar considerations for STI \\ninterventions should be considered. Latent transition \\nanalysis among both heterosexuals 75 and gay and bisexual \\nmen76 show that individuals’ allocation into speciﬁcr i s k \\ngroups remains relatively stable. However, changes in risk \\nare often observed when people move out of monogamous \\nrelationships. This is reﬂected in risk-based STI guidelines \\nfor young heterosexuals, 77 and latent transition analysis of \\nMSM regularly attending for STI testing.76 Further, these \\ndata reﬂect states of risk prior to the introduction of PrEP. \\nGiven the evidence of changes in STI risk follow PrEP \\ninitiation,27 a n dt h a tp e o p l et r a n s i t i o ni na n d o u to fP r E P \\nuse based on personal risk perception over time,78 regular \\nassessment of current risk among people presenting to \\nhealth services with any history of PrEP use is warranted. \\nFurther, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic \\nand associated public health orders have led to signiﬁ-\\ncant changes in sexual behaviour79 and breaks in PrEP \\nuse80,81 among MSM, decreases in casual sex among \\nheterosexuals, 82 and signiﬁcant declines in the frequency \\nof STI testing.83 Drops in testing in the presence of \\nongoing sexual risk have the potential to increase pools of \\nundiagnosed infection. \\nScreening for STIs \\nAlthough testing is crucial for the control of STIs, guidelines \\non who to test, and how often, vary. Many guidelines \\nhighlight speciﬁc populations that should be considered \\nfor STI screening, or recommend clinicians take a sexual \\nhistory to determine if individuals should be screened. \\nAmong populations where STIs are highly asymptomatic \\n(e.g. extra-genital infections among MSM), informed \\ndecisions around how to screen in the absence of symptoms \\nrely on understanding epidemiological contexts (historical \\nand emerging). Although broad-based guidelines, which \\nrecommend testing of entire populations (e.g. regular \\ntesting of all sexually active MSM or STI testing at \\neach PrEP prescribing visit), may lead to greater testing \\ncoverage and frequency, they present challenges for \\nmanaging clinic capacity and may impact the cost and \\ncost-eﬀectiveness of sexual health services. Such strategies \\nconsume a lot of resources and are not often feasible in \\nresource-constrained settings or where testing is not \\nfully subsidised. Further, broad-based recommendations \\nobfuscate the need for nuanced risk screening and targeted \\nhigher frequency testing for those at particularly high risk \\nor those who are diagnosed with STIs recurrently. \\nOpportunistic testing during routine visits \\nOpportunistic testing, when a test if oﬀered in-clinic during a \\nroutine patient visit, often occurs after clinicians take a sexual \\nhistory, following an electronic prompt, or if the patient \\nis identiﬁed as belonging to a speciﬁc high-risk group \\nfor which STI testing is recommended. For example, in the \\nUS, the CDC and US Preventive Services Task Force \\nrecommend annual chlamydia and gonorrhoea screening \\nfor all sexually active females aged <25 years, and annual \\nscreening for women aged >25 years with a risk factor \\n(more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent \\npartners, a new partner).84 Although such recommen-\\ndations allow clinicians to assess risk on an individual \\nbasis, signiﬁcant challenges associated with risk screening \\nexist. Clinician barriers include discomfort around \\nengaging in sexual health discussion or asking sensitive \\nquestions, feeling inadequately trained, and diﬃculty \\nincorporating a sexual screen into a regular visit due to \\ntime constraints.85 Barriers may also be magniﬁed among \\ndoctors who serve ethnically diverse populations.86 Patient \\nsexual history may also be hindered due to patient concerns \\naround conﬁdentiality and stigma, lack of perceived risk and \\nlack of sexual health awareness.87 Some of these barriers \\ncan be overcome by implementing computer-assisted self-\\ninterviewing in clinic waiting rooms, where patients \\n269'),\n",

A large cluster randomised controlled \\ntrial of opportunistic chlamydia testing in rural GP services \\nin Australia, which implemented a protocol involving \\nclinician education, computer alert prompting and reimburse-\\nments, found that even with increased testing of eligible \\npatients, the intervention was not associated with a decline \\nin chlamydia prevalence.93 However, it was associated with \\na decline in PID presentations at nearby hospitals. Additional \\ndata from the US shows that although screening among \\nheterosexuals may not reduce chlamydia prevalence, it is a \\npotentially eﬀective approach to reduce PID.94 Another \\nlarge cluster-randomised controlled trial, which assessed a \\nmulti-pronged intervention of continuous quality improve-\\nment (review of clinical data, education, implementation \\nof systems-level changes aimed at improving STI practice) \\nin general practice clinics serving remote indigenous \\npopulations in Australia, again found increases in testing, \\nbut no changes in population-level prevalence of STIs.95 \\nStrategies to increase STI testing capacity \\nConsideration of adapted service models and strategies to \\nenhance STI testing eﬃciency in established services may \\nbe required to maintain capacity for broad risk-based STI \\nscreening practices, while also increasing testing coverage \\nand frequency among those at particularly high risk. \\nAlthough technology-based systems to reduce the burden of \\nhigh frequency testing on patients have been implemented \\nat the clinic and laboratory level (e.g. results delivered \\nby SMS96), frequent testing can be challenging because of \\nrestricted clinic operating times. These types of health \\nsystems barriers make increasing patient-driven demand for \\nSTI testing diﬃcult. For example, evaluation of a large \\nAustralian health promotion campaign targeting MSM for \\nHIV and STI testing found that despite substantial investment \\nin health promotion and a high proportion of MSM recalling \\ncampaign messages, only a modest increase in chlamydia \\nand gonorrhoea testing was achieved, and the campaign \\nhad minimal impact on HIV or syphilis testing.97 Social \\nmarketing initiatives aimed at creating demand for testing \\nmust also be accompanied by structural changes that make \\nSTI testing more convenient. \\nIn order to achieve high rates of testing, adaptive and \\nconvenient service models that reduce the burden on \\npatients will be required. A recent scoping review of HIV \\nand STI testing preferences among MSM in high-income \\ncountries identiﬁed the convenience and privacy of self-\\ntesting, and the need to provide a variety of testing options, \\nas key themes of testing preferences.98 A 2016 review of \\ninterventions aimed at increasing STI screening found that \\n270'),\n",

However, opt-out \\ntesting does place the burden on clinicians to ensure \\nappropriate disclosure of the test to patients in pre-test \\ndiscussions to ensure they are aware of the implications of \\na positive result and have the opportunity to opt out. \\nSurveillance data from Australia showed opt-out testing \\nincreased rates of syphilis testing among MSM living with \\nHIV.103 Modelling work suggests that an opt-out testing \\nstrategy for all women aged 15–24 years in the US \\nwould likely reduce chlamydia prevalence, and be more \\ncost-eﬀective compared to a risk-based screening strategy; \\nhowever, this was dependent on individuals’ insurance \\ncoverage.104 In limited-resource settings or where universal \\nhealth care is not available, overall eﬀectiveness and cost-\\neﬀectiveness of such strategies would be signiﬁcantly \\nreduced. \\nTargeted testing of those at greatest risk \\nA modelling study of syphilis among Canadian MSM found \\nthat increasing screening frequency among those already \\nengaged in testing had a greater reduction on syphilis \\nincidence than increasing screening coverage (i.e. the \\nproportion of the population tested).105 Another modelling \\nstudy of MSM in the US found that both increasing the rate \\nof screening from current levels to biannual among all \\nsexually active MSM currently being tested, and increasing \\nthe coverage of biannual screening to 30% of all ‘high-risk’ \\nMSM, each reduced chlamydia and gonorrhoea incidence \\nby approximately a 75% reduction over 10 years. The \\nauthors suggest that more frequent screening for all MSM, \\nand scaling up targeted screening for men with multiple \\nrecent partners, were the most eﬀective strategies.106 US \\nguidelines recommend syphilis screening in MSM, people \\nwith HIV and pregnant women, but do not provide routine \\nscreening recommendations for HIV-negative heterosexual \\npopulations. Modelling work suggests that achieving such a \\nstrategy may have an impact on transmission in states with \\nmore MSM-focused outbreaks, but would have little or \\nno impact on transmission in states where syphilis is \\nmore evenly distributed between MSM and heterosexual \\npopulations.107 \\nGuiding public health strategies to increase active \\ncase-ﬁnding using epidemiological trends can quickly and \\neﬃciently respond to new STI outbreaks. For example, \\nmany countries utilise existing networks of general practice \\nclinicians to issue alerts around increasing rates of STIs in \\ncertain geographical areas or subpopulations. In the UK, \\noutbreaks are detected by local surveillance undertaken by \\nclinicians or health protection teams via the detection of \\nhigher than expected numbers of diagnoses.108 These are \\nsometimes supplemented by more systematic approaches \\nthat utilise automated spatiotemporal detection tools to \\nroutinely analyse notiﬁcation data.109 Following an investi-\\ngation to declare and determine the spread of an outbreak, \\ninitial stages of outbreak response usually involve alerting \\nclinicians and appropriate organisations through established \\ncommunication systems. Similar alerts in Australia are \\ncommonly issued through the general practitioner network.110 \\nSustained outbreak control can then include strategies such as \\nactive case-ﬁnding, qualitative data collection to understand \\ndrivers of the outbreak, outreach programs targeting speciﬁc \\nvenues or populations, and widespread promotion through \\nsocial and traditional media.108 These strategies can also \\nfacilitate targeted communication to non-primary care \\nclinicians who may not be routinely involved in STI care. For \\nexample, recent increases in congenital syphilis, likely related \\nto low rates of syphilis screening and issues with continuity \\nof care and treatment during pregnancy among patients \\ntested in antenatal hospital clinics in Australia,111 led to \\nspeciﬁc guidance targeted at increasing syphilis testing \\nduring pregnancy. The success of such strategies relies on \\nsurveillance infrastructure to identify and characterise new \\nSTI outbreaks in a reliable and timely manner, and appro-\\npriate levels of funding and technical support to resource a \\ntimely response. \\nOver-screening \\nIn addition to the burden of frequent STI testing incurred by \\nthe patient, there are potential harms associated with over-\\nscreening for STIs, including anxiety, psychological harm \\n271'),\n",

However, the US CDC reports \\nthere is currently limited data on psychological or other \\nharms associated with screening for chlamydia and \\ngonorrhoea among women and heterosexual men.112 \\nAmong MSM, there is growing evidence that high antibiotic \\nconsumption among PrEP users may be driving antibiotic \\nresistance. Given high rates of bacterial STIs among PrEP \\nusers, and high frequency screening and treatment, PrEP \\nusers have high levels of macrolide consumption, as well as \\nfor cephalosporins, ﬂuoroquinolones and tetracyclines.113 In \\nsome European countries, consumption of macrolides is \\n52-fold higher among PrEP users compared to community-\\nlevel consumption.113 Cohorts of PrEP users around the \\nworld are commonly characterised by having high rates of \\npartner change,27 translating to high and stable prevalence \\nof chlamydia and gonorrhoea. Long-term surveillance data \\nin Australia suggest that sustained high-frequency testing of \\nPrEP users (3-monthly) for >4 years has not curbed rates of \\nchlamydia or gonorrhoea in this group.41 In contrast, such \\nhigh-frequency screening is costly and may be driving \\nantimicrobial resistance.114 Modelling work suggests that \\neven low levels of screening for the largely asymptomatic \\nSTI Mycoplasma genitalium among MSM is leading to \\nincreased antibiotic resistance through increased, arguably \\nunnecessary treatment.115 In its resistance threats 2019 \\nreport, the US CDC has listed drug-resistant gonorrhoea on \\nits Urgent Threats list, and Mycoplasma genitalium on its \\nwatch list.116 Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance is \\ncrucial in the context of high-frequency screening and \\ntransmission. In light of the threat of antimicrobial resistance, \\nthere is a growing case for reconsidering the evidence \\nbase for high-frequency screening of STIs, which are mostly \\nasymptomatic, among populations with high and stable \\nprevalences.117 \\nIdentifying risk \\nWith the aforementioned barriers to clinician-led discus-\\nsions on sexual history during routine care, and the need \\nfor increased client-driven demand for testing, methods \\nto appropriately and eﬃciently identify risk, both from \\nthe clinician perspective and including individuals’ self-\\nperception of risk, are crucial. \\nService-identiﬁed risk \\nFor clinical services aiming to identify risk, strategies can go \\nbeyond broad testing protocols based on risk group and the \\nuse of clinical data and automated screening tools. For \\nexample, previous infection can be used as an indicator of risk. \\nHistory of an STI has consistently been shown to be one of the \\nstrongest indicators of future risk among both MSM118 and \\nadolescent heterosexuals.119 The strong predictive value of a \\nprevious diagnosis is reﬂective of high rates of reinfection, \\nsuch as that of syphilis reinfection widely observed among \\nMSM,120 especially those living with HIV.118 It is unsurpris-\\ning then that modelling work suggests that increasing \\nscreening frequency among MSM with a prior syphilis \\ndiagnosis is equally eﬀective in reducing syphilis prevalence \\nas testing focused on those reporting high partner numbers, \\nand far more eﬀective than distributing testing equally \\namong all MSM.121 Targeting individuals with a prior \\ndiagnosis of syphilis can be done through clinician-led history \\ntaking, patient management system alerts or through \\ndemand-creation approaches such as community-driven \\nawareness-raising of reinfection risk. \\nNovel methods for identifying those at risk, including \\nmachine learning and prediction modelling using electronic \\nmedical records, have also been explored, with varying \\nlevels of eﬃcacy. For example, the use of computer-assisted \\nsexual history taking allows data on behavioural risk factors \\nto be analysed using risk prediction models and machine \\nlearning. Machine learning has been successfully used to \\nidentify those who are eligible for PrEP based on medical \\nrecords;122 however, the use of machine algorithms of \\nstructured health record data have been shown to poorly \\ndiﬀerentiate patients with and without repeat STI diagnosis, \\nindicating that they may be less useful for predicting STI \\nrisk.123 Prediction models of routinely collected healthcare \\ndata have been used in emergency room settings where \\nlaboratory variables are collected and can be used for risk \\nprediction.124 Despite growing work on machine learning, \\nsuch techniques require technical capacity, education and \\ntraining, and access to ‘big data’ through which to generate \\npredictive algorithms. Also, as prediction methods rely \\non patient history, they would likely provide less beneﬁt \\nin determining STI risk for patients attending clinics \\nsporadically or for the ﬁrst time. \\nRisk self-identiﬁcation \\nAlong with clinical services being able to adequately identify \\nSTI risk, patient-driven demand for STI testing relies heavily \\non individuals recognising their own risk, and seeking STI \\ntesting. An analysis of adults in the UK found that both men \\nand women underestimate their self-risk of STIs, and that \\nmany who did perceive themselves as at-risk had not \\nrecently accessed STI care.125 Health promotion, therefore, \\nshould not only focus on improving self-identiﬁcation of \\nrisk, but also encourage people to act on their perceived \\nself-risk by accessing care. Perception of the seriousness of \\nSTIs has been shown to vary considerably among speciﬁc \\nsubgroups of MSM at high risk of STIs,126 and may \\ninﬂuence an individual's decision to present for testing \\nfollowing possible exposure to an STI or following windows \\nof risk, if they perceive the health risk of an STI going \\nundiagnosed to be low. Along with perceptions of risk, STI \\nknowledge has also been linked to recent STI testing,127 \\n272\"),\n",

Early programs often focused on ABC  \\n(Abstinence, Be faithful, use Condoms). Condoms provide tri -\\nple protection, against the transmission of HIV and other sexu -\\nally transmitted infections as well protection against unintended  \\npregnancy1. Condom social marketing programs were the first \\nHIV programs to reach national scale in many countries. The \\nnumber of condoms distributed through social marketing pro -\\ngrams increased from about 590 million annually in 1991 to  \\n2.5 billion by 2012 before declining to about 1.7 billion in  \\n20192. Across 55 countries with a recent national household sur -\\nvey as part of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) or \\nAIDS Indicator Surveys (AIS) about 60 percent of men reported \\nusing a condom the last time they had sex with a non-marital, \\nnon-cohabiting partner and 65 percent report using a condom  \\nthe last time they visited a sex worker (Table 1).\\nIn all low- and middle-income countries about 16 billion con -\\ndoms are used annually with about 7.5 billion used primarily for \\nHIV prevention 1. Since these figures are based on self-reports  \\nof condom use, they may over-state actual use. However, it is \\nclear that large numbers of condoms have been procured and/\\nor distributed with the intention of helping users prevent HIV  \\ntransmission.\\nStudies have shown condoms to be highly effective against \\nHIV3, other sexually transmitted infections 4 and unintended  \\npregnancy5. Consistent use is required to maximize an indi -\\nvidual’s protection. However, even inconsistent use will provide  \\nsome benefit that can be large at a population-level6.\\nAcross all DHS surveys about three-fifths of people report  \\nrelying on the public sector for their condom supply. Social  \\nmarketing programs provide nearly 2 billion condoms each year  \\n(https://www.dktinternational.org/contraceptive-social-market -\\ning-statistics/), about Thus, international donor and national \\ngovernment funding for condom purchase, distribution and pro -\\nmotion plays a large role in supporting the widespread use of  \\ncondoms.\\nThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the global impact of \\ncondoms on the HIV epidemic through both retrospective and  \\nprospective analyses.\\nMethods\\nWe used a publicly available mathematical simulation model, \\nthe Goals mode l7, to examine the impact of past and future  \\ncondom use on the AIDS epidemic in 77 high burden countries. \\nWe used version 6.06 of the Goals model, which is available for  \\nfree download at https://www.avenirhealth.org/software-spec-\\ntrum.php. The source code for the calculations is available as \\nExtended data 8. This is the same model that was used to esti -\\nmate epidemiological impact for the new UNAIDS Global HIV  \\nStrategy9.\\nGoals is a simulation model that calculates HIV transmission \\namong different population risk groups (monogamous hetero -\\nsexual couples, those with multiple heterosexual partners, female  \\nsex workers and clients, men who have sex with men (MSM), \\nand people who inject drugs (PWID)) on the basis of their behav -\\niors (number of partners, contacts per partner, condom use, age \\nat first sex, needle sharing) and characteristics that influence  \\ntransmission (presence of other sexually transmitted infections, \\nstage of infection, male circumcision, and use of antiretrovi -\\nral therapy (ART) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)). The \\nmodel uses data on behaviors drawn from national surveys, such \\nas DHS, and program data on the coverage of ART and pro -\\ngrams to prevent mother-to-child transmission, PMTCT, from \\nUNAIDS’ HIV database. The model is fit to official estimates \\nof HIV prevalence trends for each county, also available from  \\nUNAIDS.\\nHIV transmission is calculated as a function of epidemiologi -\\ncal factors and the behavioral factors listed above. For unin -\\nfected people in each risk group, the probability of becoming  \\ninfected in a year is given by the following equation:\\nPs,r,t =    {1-[Prevs’,r,t × (1-rs × Ss,r,t × STIs,r,t × MCt × Cr,t × PrEPs,r,t × \\nARTs,r,t)a + (1-Prevs’,r,t)]n}\\nWhere:\\nPs,r,t          = Annual probability of becoming infected for a person  \\nof sex s in risk group r at time t\\nPrevs’,r,t    = HIV prevalence in the partner population in risk group  \\nr at time t\\nrs              = probability of transmission per sex act by type of act \\n(heterosexual, homosexual)\\nSs,r,t         = multiplier based on the stage of infection (primary  \\nstage, chronic stage or late stage)\\nMCr,t      = multiplier based on male circumcision status\\nSTIr,t      = multiplier based on STI prevalence\\nCr,t         = multiplier based on condom use\\nPrEPr,s,t  = multiplier based on the use of PrEP\\nARTs,t    = multiplier based on ART use\\nar,t           = number of acts per partner per year in risk group g at \\ntime t\\nnr,t          = number of partners per year in risk group g at time t\\n\\u2003 \\u2003 \\u2003 \\u2003 \\u2003 Amendments \\u2003 from \\u2003 Version \\u2003 1\\nThis version has updates that respond to reviewers comments. \\nIt adds detail on data sources, more detail on the equations and \\nexpands the discussion. \\nAny \\u2003 further \\u2003 responses \\u2003 from \\u2003 the \\u2003 reviewers \\u2003 can \\u2003 be \\u2003 found \\u2003 at \\u2003\\nthe \\u2003 end \\u2003 of \\u2003 the \\u2003 article\\nREVISED\\nPage 3 of 17\\nGates Open Research 2022, 5:91 Last updated: 18 MAR 2022'),\n",

Effectiveness rates used in \\nthis analysis are 0.6 for male circumcision 10–12, 0.8 for condoms 3, \\n0.8 for PrEP 13–16 and 0.95 for ART 17. The probability of infec -\\ntion per act and the STI and stage of infection multipliers are \\nselected from within published ranges to best fit the epidemic in \\neach country. Ranges are 0.0008 – 0.0016 for the probability of \\ninfection per act 18,19, 2–11 for STIs 20,21, 0.8–44 for primary stage  \\ninfection22–24 and 4–12 for symptomatic stage infection 22. The \\nnumber of contacts per partner and the number of partners per \\nyear are exponents in the equation to convert the risk per act into \\na cumulative risk of infection across all acts and all partners.  \\nCondom coverage represents the percentage of sexual acts that \\ninvolve condom use. Since the model does not track individu -\\nals separately, it does not distinguish between consistent and \\ninconsistent use. Each condom used has the effect of reduc -\\ning the probability of transmission for that act. The cumulative  \\nimpact across all acts is the net effect of condom use7.\\nWe applied the Goals model to 77 countries that together \\naccount for 94% of new infections globally in 2019 ( https://aid-\\nsinfo.unaids.org/) and then scaled-up the result to correspond \\nto the global epidemic. The full list of countries included is in  \\nUnderlying data8. The model is implemented for each individual \\ncountry by using country-specific data for demographic indica -\\ntors (base year population, fertility, mortality, and migration)  \\n(https://population.un.org/wpp/), behavioral indicators (number \\nand type of partners, condom use) from national household sur -\\nveys ( https://www.statcompiler.com/en/), and HIV program data \\n(number of people on ART and number of women receiving \\nprophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) \\nand number of male circumcisions) ( https://aidsinfo.unaids.org/).  \\nThe model is fit to data on prevalence from surveys, surveil -\\nlance, and routine testing by varying the epidemiological \\nparameters within published ranges. The ranges used for the  \\nepidemiological parameters and the fitted values by country are \\nprovided in the underlying data.Historical trends in condom use \\nby population group were estimated from self-reported condom \\nuse in DHS. Reported condom use in commercial sex was used \\nfor sex worker contact, reported use among those engaging in  \\nhigher-risk sex was used for those with multiple partners and \\nreported condom use for contraception was used for those with \\none partner. Information on the size of key populations is from  \\nthe UNAIDS Key Population Atlas (https://kpatlas.unaids.org/).\\nOnce the model was fit to each country’s actual epidemic we \\nconducted three analyses: (1) a retrospective analysis that esti -\\nmates the number of additional HIV infections that would have  \\nhappened if condom use rates stayed constant from 1990 to  \\n2019, (2) a prospective analysis that compares the number of \\nnew HIV infections expected to occur between 2020 and 2030 \\nif condom use rates remain at 2019 levels or increase to reach  \\nUNAIDS targets of 95% of casual and sex work contacts pro -\\ntected by condom use by 2025, and (3) a prospective analysis \\nthat compares constant condom use rates from 2019 to 2030 with \\na future where all key HIV interventions increase to UNAIDS \\ntargets by 2030 25 for key populations (sex workers, MSM,  \\nPWID, transgender people and prisoners), adolescent girls and \\nyoung women, adolescent boys and young men, adults aged 25+, \\nHIV-positive pregnant women and people living with HIV .

Impact for each of the modeled countries is shown in the  \\nUnderlying data 8. The largest absolute impacts, in terms of \\ninfections averted, are seen in the countries with the largest \\npopulations or highest prevalence (South Africa, India, China, \\nKenya and Tanzania) while the highest relative impact occurs \\nin countries with low burden currently where condom use \\nhelped to avert a larger epidemic (Guatemala, China, United  \\nKingdom, Italy, Mongolia and Bangladesh).\\nThe sensitivity analysis of condom effectiveness indicates \\nthat the estimate of 117 million infections averted could be as  \\nlow as 70 million or as high as 130 million.\\nWe do not know how many condoms were used globally \\nbetween 1990 and 2019 but if we assume that condom use was \\nvery low in 1990 and scaled up to near today’s rates by 2010  \\nand remained approximately constant from 2010 to 2019, then  \\ntotal condom consumption for HIV prevention would have been \\naround 160 billion for that period. This implies a global aver -\\nage of about 1300 condoms per infection averted. At an aver -\\nage cost per condom distributed of about $0.18 27 the cost per \\ninfection averted by condoms during 1990–2019 is about  \\n$230.170\\nFigure 2  shows the two projections from 2019 to 2030. If  \\ncondom use rates remained at their 2019 levels and all other \\ninterventions also had constant coverage, then the annual number \\nof new HIV infections would rise slowly due to constant inci -\\ndence and a growing population. If condom use rates scaled-up  \\neverywhere to the UNAIDS target of 95% of all risky sex acts \\nand all other prevention interventions remained at 2019 cover -\\nage levels, then the number of new infections would decline \\nto 1.1 million 2030. The difference between these two lines \\nindicates that condom scale-up would avert about 3.6 million  \\nHIV infections over that period, about 20% of those that would \\noccur without condom scale-up. Figure 2  also shows that the \\nrapid scale-up of condom use could produce about one-third \\nthe impact as the full UNAIDS strategy, which scales up all the  \\nintervention mentioned above to UNAIDS targets.\\nDiscussion\\nCondom use has increased dramatically since the beginning of \\nthe HIV epidemic.

But this just illustrates the \\nbenefits of early intervention. Early increases in condom use \\namong key populations, in particular sex workers and their  \\nclients, as well as with non-regular partners has slowed early \\ntransmission and helped to avert a much larger epidemic in the  \\ngeneral population.\\nThere are several limitations to this analysis. We rely on  \\nself-reports of condom use in national surveys that may over-state  \\nactual use. The effectiveness of condoms depends on correct \\nand consistent use but measures of these factors are not well \\ndeveloped. Our modeling estimates the impact of condom use \\nin aggregate population groups but does not model individual \\nbehavior. Using these data our models can replicate historical  \\nepidemic trends in the countries modeled but that does not \\nensure that they are correct. Findings of this analysis are,  \\nhowever, broadly consistent with other mathematical modelling  \\nanalyses of the impact of condom use 29,30. Estimates of the size \\nof key populations in each country are based on small sample  \\nsurveys which may not be representative of the entire country.  \\nEstimates of the number of acts per partner are based on small \\nstudies or potentially unreliable self-reports. To some extent,  \\nthese limitations are addressed by fitting the model to histori -\\ncal data on prevalence. While the fitting does not guarantee that \\nall the inputs are correct, it does ensure that the set of inputs \\nis sufficient to replicate the historical epidemic. In spite of  \\nabove-mentioned limitations, the case for the importance of \\ncondoms as an ongoing component of HIV programming is  \\ncompelling.\\nPrevious modeling studies have shown the impact of histori -\\ncal condom scale-up in specific populations in specific-countries  \\nincluding sex workers in Benin 31 and MSM in Beijing,  \\nChina32. Other studies have modeled the potential impact of  \\nprograms to scale-up condom use, including adolescents in the \\nUnited States 33 and hypothetical but representative settings 34.  \\nAll found significant impacts of condom use, but none examined \\nthe global impact. Condoms are a good investment. The total \\ncost to prevent one new HIV infection with condoms is small \\ncompared to life-time costs of treatment meaning that condom  \\ninvestments now will save future expenditures on treatment. \\nSince many people rely on free or subsidized condoms, it is  \\ncrucial to ensure adequate funding for condom programs, includ -\\ning demand creation activities and frequent behavioral data  \\ncollection.\\nWhile condoms are not a magic bullet that alone can control \\nthe HIV epidemic, they remain a critical part of the prevention \\nresponse.

Yet, STIs have widespread impacts, which are wors-\\nening as antibiotics become less effective (Unemo et al., 2017 ). It is estimated that one million\\nSTIs are acquired every day across the world, with 129 million cases of chlamydia, 82 million\\ncases of gonorrhoea and 7.1 million incidents of syphilis documented internationally each year\\n(WHO, 2023b ). There has been a lack of interest, political will or economic investment to\\nproactively engage in rising resistance for STIs. While HIV, with associated high mortality and\\nsocietal costs, has been a focus of significant investment, innovation and subsequent drug\\ndevelopment, bacterial STIs have languished in the cultural shadows (WHO, 2012 ; WHO, 2021 ).\\nThis is, as our participants reflect on below, in part due to enduring sexual taboos (Lichten-\\nstein, 2003 ; Nesamoney et al., 2022 ) and perceptions of STIs being ‘less serious’ than other\\nillnesses. Yet, a cliff edge is nearing with rising resistance, and in particular, serious concerns\\nraised about AMR in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhoea) and Mycoplasma genitalium (Iwuji\\net al., 2022 ; WHO, 2023a ).\\nHere, drawing on a series of interviews with clinical, expert and industry stakeholders, we\\nexamine STIs resistance and the aligned problem of antibiotic ‘overuse’, to explore their views\\non how prevailing ‘treatment cultures’ emerge and sustain themselves, and their implications\\nfor rising rates of resistance. This is placed within a broader scene whereby sexual health\\npractitioners are being asked to be increasingly judicious with antimicrobials (Kenyon\\net al., 2023 ; Tompson & Chandler, 2021 ) to kerb resistance.\\nThe idea of ‘treatment cultures’, we argue below, is instructive for advancing the sociology of\\nAMR, which has already done considerable work to explore the phenomena of resistance\\nbeyond mere biology, or individual or practitioner decision‐making (e.g. Adam et al., 2020 ;\\nBroom et al., 2017 ; Broom et al., 2021 ; Broom et al., 2023 ; Chandler, 2020 ), to explore its\\nembeddedness in structural fragilities, economic priorities and cultures of immediacy, among\\nmany other bio‐social forms (Will, 2018 ; see also Brown & Nettleton, 2017b on resistance\\nimaginaries). Thinking with a ‘cultures’ frame provides an abstraction to help make sense of\\nhow bio‐social forms assemble modes of practice.\\nIt also remains that thus far, little of the sociological AMR scholarship has touched on STI\\nrelated issues, which as a case study and site of sociality throws up unique dimensions which\\nare instructive for the broader scene of AMR.

Moreover, an exploration of the perception of treatment cultures within such a\\ncontext, sheds light on the tussle between normative influences, interpersonal desires to\\nameliorate illness and provide care, whilst concurrently pursing efforts to curb AMR.\\nBACKGROUND\\nEpistemologies of STIs\\nThe ‘successes’ of antimicrobial treatments for STIs have, to some extent, given rise to a critical\\nparadox. As new antibiotics were introduced over the decades to treat gonorrhoea, for example,\\nthese treatment ‘successes’ have subsequently become ‘failures’ in their ability to cure the\\ndisease due to rising rates of AMR. In other words, initial successes of antimicrobials have\\ndiminished in their returns over time. In the 1930s, sulfonamides were used to treat gonorrhoea\\ninfections, but by the late 1940s more than 90% of gonococcal isolates showed resistance to\\nsulfonamides, leading to a replacement of the treatment with penicillin (Jose et al., 2020 ;\\nUnemo & Shafer, 2014 ; Workowksi et al., 2008 ). However, resistance to penicillin was emerging\\nas early as 1946 (Jose et al., 2020 ). This saw the introduction of chlortetracycline to treat\\npenicillin resistant strains, which led to the emergence of tetracycline resistance, and by the\\n1980s resistance to penicillin and tetracycline meant azithromycin and fluroquinolones became\\npreferred modes of treatment (Unemo & Shafer, 2014 ; Workowksi et al., 2008 ). In the 1990 and\\n2000s, resistance to azithromycin in European countries, the United States and Argentina\\nmeant it was no longer used as a single dose treatment for gonorrhoea (Unemo & Shafer, 2014 ).\\nIncreasing resistance to fluroquinolones during the 2000s saw this class of antibiotics also being\\nabandoned in European and Asian countries (Unemo & Shafer, 2014 ). Cephalosporins, such as\\nceftriaxone and cefixime have been used since the 1990s, however, as a result of increasing\\nconcerns about resistance (CDC, 2021 ), combination antimicrobial treatment (ceftriaxone and\\nazithromycin) is now the standard of care. However, this approach results in antibiotic resis-\\ntance pressure for other organisms such as Mycoplasma genitalium and non‐STI enteric path-\\nogens, and some countries have moved away from the combination antimicrobial approach for\\nthis reason (CDC, 2021 ).\\nWhile this narrative may appear to be about unfortunate biological processes, this is a partial\\naccount, with swiftly rising resistance embedded in societal processes including the perception\\nof microbes, economic and political priorities, misuse of resources and critically, prevailing\\nnotions of ‘appropriate treatment’ (Andraka‐Christou, 2020 ; Baccini et al., 2022 ; Sell & Wil-\\nliams, 2020 ). This is evident in the multitude of strains of thought, and frameworks, for making\\nsense of STIs (Aral, 2002 ; Crosby et al., 2016 ). Kenyon ( 2020 ) and Kenyon et al. ( 2022 ) broadly\\ndifferentiate between these as individualist vis‐à‐vis ecological epistemologies for understanding\\nSTIs. They argue that the former tends to focus on intensive screening, eradication of microbes\\nand individual characteristics and behaviours of people, while the latter focuses on contexts,\\ninterdependencies and multi‐level analysis. Whilst there is an intermingling of viewpoints\\n(Kenyon, 2020 ), enduring divisions still permeate the STI milieu. The influence of epistemo-\\nlogical framings, such as individual versus ecological, shapes the way diseases are perceived,\\nprioritised and ultimately treated. For example, an individualist framework will place emphasis\\non a disease and its elimination through antibiotics, whilst an ecological framework opens\\ngreater space for considerations about how these antibiotics affect other aspects of a person’s\\nTREATMENT ‘CULTURES’, SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS\\n-\\n3 of 21\\n 14679566, 2025, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9566.13832, Wiley Online Library on [31/01/2025].

This points to how treatment,\\noften deemed to be the appropriate and ‘medico‐scientific’ approach, turns out to be a cultural\\nformation, sometimes enacting longer term harm, and therefore open to reflexivity, interro-\\ngation and transformation. We argue that such deliberations are critical to dealing with the\\ncurrent threat of antibiotic resistant STIs.\\nSTI care through a ‘cultures’ lens\\nBuilding on the accounts of our participants shown below, here we focus on ‘treatment cul-\\ntures’, as an important context for engaging with the presence and problem of resistance\\n(Jenks, 2005 ).\\n1\\nThe turn towards viewing practice‐as‐culture may seem like a rather pedestrian\\nnotion, yet as social scientists have shown across multiple sites and contexts (Armstrong, 1995 ;\\nGood & Hannah, 2010 ; Kleinman et al., 1978 ; Mol, 2002 , 2008 ), such a framing has the potential\\nto better illuminate complex and contingent practices such as antibiotic use by highlighting\\nhitherto hidden values, prevailing epistemologies and the highly selective ontologies at the\\nintersection of bugs, bodies and intervention. That is, a ‘culture’ framing means paying atten-\\ntion to how science and medicine, in this case of and around STIs, constructs the objects/\\nsubjects it seeks to intervene upon, thus foregrounding and foreclosing the potential actions that\\ncan be taken in relation to them and how these normative forces may also be troubled, resisted\\nand revised by those responsible for delivering care.\\nConnecting with the ecological framework raised above (Kenyon et al., 2022 ), a cultures\\nframe also fully links instances of intervention or treatment (i.e. testing for STIs or deployment\\nof antibiotics) with their disparate and multidimensional personal, interpersonal and structural\\ninfluences. This includes recognising that these multidimensional and entangled influences\\nreach well beyond the clinic and into the realms of the multi‐scalar, spanning organisations and\\npublic, private and corporate entities (Ecks, 2005 ; Fisher et al., 2015 ; Gagnon & Lexchin, 2008 ).\\nThus treatment cultures and aligned practices are always emergent at the interstices of culture,\\neconomy, expertise and evolving technologies. This also allows for the notion of different,\\nplural, treatment cultures (within health systems, across nations, across spaces/locales and so\\non), acknowledging the multiple ways of doing STI care (WHO, 2016 ). Critically, seeing\\ntreatment as culturally co‐produced, centres the multidimensional changes that need to take\\nplace (Tompson & Chandler, 2021 ), including how infection, antibiotics and care are thought\\nabout and the normative practices surrounding them.\\nAs suggested, treatment cultures have normative, discursive and practical aspects, which\\ncirculate and are emergent over time and across contexts (Armstrong, 1995 ). Rather than still or\\nset, treatment cultures evolve in relation to such things as technological change, management\\nstandards, evidence‐making and communities of practice (Broom et al., 2017 ; Mol, 2008 ). They\\nare never settled, but also, have normative, structuring aspects, which in context of this study\\nassemble to create dominant modes of practice through routine, guidelines, ideas about\\n‘healthy’ bodies and available resources (see ASHM National Prep Guidelines, 2021 ). Moreover,\\nbecause treatment cultures are always emergent, they as much about practices of treatment, as\\nthey are about reflections on these practises, which may challenge the need to treat all instances\\nof infection itself (Armstrong, 2018 ).\\nIn the context of this study, our understanding of the dominant treatment culture—as both\\nnormative force and everyday practice—emerges from the reflexivity of participants, and is\\nlocated in their reflexive practices, in much the same way that for example, racism or sexism\\n4 of 21\\n-\\nCHANDRA ET AL .\\n 14679566, 2025, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9566.13832, Wiley Online Library on [31/01/2025].

We present findings from qualitative interviews that were\\nconducted from 2021 to 2023 with a diverse range of stakeholders with expertise in STIs and\\nAMR. Stakeholders were recruited by purposively sampling through researcher networks, to\\nensure participants possessed the appropriate expertise required for the project. Data collection\\nentailed in‐depth, semi‐structured interviews with stakeholders working to curb AMR in\\nclinical, private sector and pan‐national contexts. Participants ( n = 23; male = 10, female = 13)\\nwere comprised of sexual health clinicians and general practitioners, key industry stakeholders\\ninvolved in pharmaceutical and/or diagnostic research and development, and representatives of\\npeak pan‐national organisations. All clinical participants ( n = 13) came from Australia. Par-\\nticipants representing industry and pan‐national organisations held professional roles in\\nAustralia ( n = 5), Europe ( n = 3) and the US ( n = 2). As such, this study has a lean towards\\nAustralian experiences ( n = 18). Video conferencing was used to conduct interviews by authors\\nAlex Broom, Michelle Peterie and Lise Lafferty. They ranged between 30 and 60 min. Interviews\\nwere audio‐recorded and transcribed verbatim. This involved the removal of all identifying\\ninformation to preserve participant confidentiality. Interview questions and discussions\\nrevolved around three key themes: participants’ perceptions and direct experiences of AMR in\\nthe context of STIs, their ongoing efforts to develop and implement AMR solutions in their\\nrespective contexts, and support or challenges faced when working to do so. Key interview\\nquestions to illicit this information included: What are the main strategies currently used to\\nameliorate resistance in STIs, in your context? What do you see as the main (short, mid and/or\\nand longer term) costs in terms of effects of resistant STIs? To what extent does AMR shape\\nyour practice in STI care, and has this changed over time?

We will use quotes from interviews\\nto illustrate key themes, and to support interpretation of the data.\\nRESULTS\\nThe politics of treatment cultures\\nWhilst clinical interactions and exchanges may not always seem entangled in politics and\\neconomics, they inevitably are, shaping the potential of treatment cultures (Dixon et al., 2021 ).\\nThe limits and boundaries of possibility are very often induced or foreclosed outside of the\\nclinic. Often weaving in cultural ideologies, and the undulations of secrecy and taboo in STIs,\\nprevailing treatment cultures are at least partially assembled in policy decision‐making, political\\nblind‐spots and/or practices of scientific deprioritising. As interviewees explained, the flows\\nfrom political interest are strong and enduring, with the complex intersection of stigma, and the\\nidea of ‘undeserving’ subjects creating a perfect storm for a lethargy of action to improve STI\\npractices in relation to rising resistance. As one participant told us below:\\nIt’s not pleasant discussion to have with someone about syphilis and gonorrhoea and\\nall of that. Politicians aren’t interested, and it would be the brave politician that\\nmight take that on because, again, that would be seen as something a bit ‐ it’s not\\none of those things that people donate lots of money to […] Children’s research,\\nendless money.

It’s their fault that they’ve got\\nthis.” There’s a lot of blame associated with STIs over any other disease.\\n(Clinician, Australia)\\nDeservingness of attention and investment of resources was simultaneously tied to the\\nperceived severity of STIs within the accounts of our participants.

This has a po-\\ntential impact on innovation, proactive policy and good governance (or lack thereof).\\nUltimately, the prioritisation of STIs was talked about within the interviews as located\\nwithin a prevailing cultural imaginary where stigma, personal responsibility and perceptions of\\nseverity heavily influence treatment, and treatment cultures, resulting in a relative paucity of\\nresources being allocated to addressing antibiotic resistant STIs. This lack of prioritisation\\nconcurrently weaves through instances of care, significantly shaping treatment cultures,\\nincluding the intersection of practice and innovation.\\nThe practice–innovation nexus\\nWhilst often beyond the view of interventions in the clinic, interviews revealed that scientific\\ninnovation, technological development and the limits of industrial production/distribution are\\nintegral to both assembling and developing treatment cultures, creating or foreclosing material\\npossibilities (i.e., new drugs and new diagnostics). As such, broadening the lens within which\\nSTI care is viewed, shows how prevailing treatment cultures exist at the nexus of economical–\\nsocial–political considerations.\\nThe influence of these matters is evident, for instance, in the ongoing urgency for quicker\\nand more accessible tests to be made available, to identify STIs (e.g., Neisseria gonorrhoea ) and\\nspecific strains of STIs, allowing clinicians to provide faster and more exacting treatments as\\nfollows:\\nI think because we have a lack of point‐of‐care testing. So if we have a bedside test\\nwhere we can do a point‐of‐care test and tell the patient that, “In 10–15 minutes we\\ncan give you a result, so we know whether to actually treat you for this condition or\\nnot.” It’s just that we don’t have the lab technology. So, as a result of that, you’ve got\\na patient in front of you who’s unwell, who’s at risk of spreading it to other partners\\nif not treated then and there. We are overtreating because we don’t know what the\\ncausative organism is. Whereas if we had point of care testing, that way you can get\\nan answer in real time, you’d be able to overcome that.\\n(Clinician, Australia)\\nSo, having a specific mutation on a molecular test, similar to what they have for\\ntuberculosis, this molecular testing for rifampicin and isoniazid‐resistant tubercu-\\nlosis, so you know quite quickly, initially, but then you should give first‐line treat-\\nment or change the treatment. So, I think something like that would be great for\\nsexual health while you’re balancing the need to treat quickly versus trying to target\\nyour treatment appropriately.\\n(Clinician, Australia)\\nThese material possibilities—and, indeed, current technological limitations—are imbricated\\nwith and emerge from financial viabilities, and politically driven cost‐benefit considerations.\\nThey are also connected with the flailing pipeline of drug and diagnostic innovation, which is\\ndeeply interconnected with public sector priorities (see Peterie et al., 2023 ).

As a participant stated below:\\nFor example, when somebody comes in with, say, proctitis, we treat them syn-\\ndromically for all the organisms because they’re in a lot of pain and they want\\ntreatment at that point, but we’re treating many organisms over a period of time\\nwithout having a diagnosis, without having a cause for that condition.

This means\\nthe slippage of antibiotics from ‘solution’ to ‘non‐solution’ and even (in certain instances) to\\n‘problem maker’ (by increasing resistance) remains obfuscated.\\nAlongside syndromic care, STI care practices—which enable prevailing treatment cultures—\\nsubject bodies to routine surveillance, identifying disease and preparing bodies for microbial\\nelimination. This in and of itself is not inherently positive or negative, but as noted by participants,\\nneeds to be thought about carefully in the context of resistant STIs. For instance, in Australia, pre‐\\nexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV transmission was introduced in 2018, and guidelines\\nsuggest users of PrEP, predominantly men who have sex with men (MSM), are reviewed and tested\\nevery three months for HIV, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhoea (ASHM National Prep Guide-\\nlines, 2021 ). This has led to higher rates of testing within this group, as accessing PrEP requires a\\nnew script every 3 months, which includes the aforementioned screening. However, interviewees\\nexpressed concerns that these guidelines, and subsequent treatment cultures in the STI milieu,\\nhave led to over testing and subsequently even greater antibiotic use (Williams et al., 2023 ). This,\\ninterviewees stressed, is contributing to selective pressure on microbes to encourage resistance,\\nyet is not reducing the prevalence of disease:\\n[A] lot of these patients that we pick up on asymptomatic screening, yes, okay, we\\nmight treat that asymptomatic rectal gonorrhoea in that patient and it might be gone\\nfor seven days or something, but then they might go right back into that same‐sexual\\nnetwork where they haven’t had all of those contacts treated and they might get it\\nagain a week later, two weeks later. There is evidence that a lot of these infections,\\nasymptomatic infections, the body will clear by itself over a matter of weeks to\\nmonths.

Antimicrobial\\nresistance, antibiotic resistance has risen, prevalence is staying the same, so how are\\nwe winning in that sphere?\\n(Clinician, Australia)\\nAs such, the introduction of new medications, like PrEP, becomes embedded within pre‐\\nexisting logics and priorities that favour disease elimination as always good ‘care’, perpetu-\\nating and strengthening norms around this approach despite the downsides:\\nAnd I think part of that is that, as healthcare providers, the contract is between you\\nand that patient that’s in front of you, that you want to do the best for, not the next\\npatient, the patient after, or the patient in two weeks, or the patient who’s out in the\\ncommunity who will be potentially affected by how you deliver antibiotics today. So,\\nthere’s this disconnect between the practise of medicine and that surrounding issue\\nof AMR.\\n(Expert, Europe)\\nSuch care practices, seeking to eliminate disease, were also evident in presumptive antibiotic\\nuse (although a decreasing measure now), where contacts of a known STI case are treated on\\nthe assumption they may have the disease. In these circumstances antibiotic use is premised on\\nan imagined future, where an infected subject carries a disease, and such an imagining is then\\nembroiled within a logic of disease elimination even if the disease itself does not necessarily\\nexist. As a participant explained:\\n… I think we were always of the view, in my earlier days, probably the first 20 years,\\n25 years of my career, that if someone was a named contact they would be treated.\\nAnd I think a lot of the nurses, especially the older nurses still feel that way because\\nthat’s what’s been drummed into us. If you’re a contact, you get treated. But there’s\\nbeen more and more studies […] that suggests that you don’t need to do that for most\\npeople, and that it may well be a better use of resources not to treat that individual at\\nthat particular time, but to wait until we get a result […] but certainly clinician\\nsentiment has changed in that I think we can see that evolving to wait until we get a\\nresult back.\\n(Clinician, Australia)\\nAs suggested, the use of PrEP itself is also underpinned by an imagined future, where one\\nmay contract HIV, and therefore the body is ‘(pre)treated’ to prevent this from happening.\\nInterviews reveal that such future thinking within treatment cultures, and the epitomisation of\\nthe disease‐free body as ‘health’, creates an immediacy in the treatment of STIs such as gon-\\norrhoea and chlamydia.

So, I think that’s why there’s been a difference.\\n(Clinician, Australia)\\nLike other cultures, treatment cultures are also uneven and contradictory. In this instance,\\nthe treatment culture is ‘at peace’ with bodies occupying an unknown and liminal space of\\npotentially being ‘infected’ and not in complete ‘health’. The same approach, however, is not\\nextended to gonorrhoea or chlamydia, suggesting cultural practices and imaginaries have his-\\ntorically congealed differently around particular infections and diseases, including the later\\ndiscovery and research on Mycoplasma genitalium (Unemo & Jensen, 2017 ).

These concerns about gut microbiome, wider\\nhealth and antibiotic use vis‐à‐vis STI treatment, also challenge contemporary western\\nbiomedical epistemologies. Such epistemologies tend to conceptualise disease and ailments as\\nsingular ‘events’ in need of treatment, as opposed to existing along a holistic continuum of\\nmind–bodies and how interventions can have unintended consequences. That is to say, the\\nconcerns about gut microbiome articulated by patients to interviewees entails a rethinking of\\nthe mind–body link, as constituted by a complex system, where treatment and disease have\\nconsequences for the entire organism. Furthermore, the emergence of a counter‐treatment\\nculture can also be seen as constituted by a process of ‘re‐designation’, where antibiotics’\\nmeanings are being re‐cast:\\nAnd I think if everyone could actually sit down and say, “Look, antibiotics are\\nactually precious.

This includes the complexities of how in-\\nstitutions, practices, patient subjectivities and professional norms assemble antibiotic use and\\nresistance (Dixon et al., 2021 ; Rynkiewich et al., 2023 ; Tompson & Chandler, 2021 ) and work\\nagainst change. Given most participants in this study have experience working in the Global\\nNorth, our analysis of these processes is contextually limited, most specifically to Australia.\\nIn light of the existent AMR scholarship, our study illustrates how stigma and taboo lead to\\nprocesses of de‐prioritisation, which has implications for the development of innovations, and\\nsubsequently the types of care (or not) that clinicians are able to provide, which may assist in\\ncurbing the rise of AMR. It also shows how resistance induces new tensions within the STI field\\npertaining to syndromic treatment and care, including the way patient subjectivities and con-\\ntexts, such as homophobia or physical pain, may necessitate syndromic treatment, highlighting\\nthe challenge of balancing presents and futures in such a context. As such, the particularities of\\nour case study extends sociological scholarship on AMR, by further complicating the ways in\\nwhich resistance plays out across economic, institutional and clinical spheres. This inserts an\\nimportant new layer to our comprehension of the bio‐social dimensions of resistance, which is\\ncritical to both comprehension of AMR as a highly diversified scene, and important for gaining\\ntraction in any proposed solutions. In saying this, we note an analysis of treatment cultures may\\nbe limited in its generalisability.

Such a frame of\\nreference shifts the emphasis away from the infection as a singular organism that causes disease\\nin the present, to a more complex and panoramic understanding that considers the future of\\nantibiotic use (see Kenyon et al., 2022 for an in‐depth discussion). This exists in tension with\\npositive aspects of treatment cultures as described by participants, where clinicians seek to\\nprovide genuine care, whilst considering the subjectivities and contexts of their patients.\\nAs a result, a paradoxical relationship to treatment practices emerges at the crossroads of\\nindividual needs vis‐à‐vis broader concerns about the rise of resistant STIs. While participants\\nunderstood the need to administer antibiotics in a more considered manner to preserve their ef-\\nficacy, they simultaneously recognised that patients experiencing significant pain and discomfort\\nshould be treated, even if this is based on symptoms. As Mol ( 2008 : 74) states, ‘in the logic of care\\nattentiveness and specificity are good and neglect is bad’. The point is not to simply withhold\\ntreatment. Rather it is to take measures, where possible, such as reduced testing to not detect\\nasymptomatic infections, or waiting for results to deliver more precise treatment, which may help\\ncurb the rise of AMR. Considering this, we argue that clinicians are balancing two forms of care,\\nwhich includes care for the individual in the present, and care for the collective future that needs\\nantibiotics to last. In this sense, clinicians must navigate the tensions of individualist and\\necological frames, as they decide who to care for, and how, occupying positions at the intersection\\nof the dominant treatment culture, concerns about AMR, and caring for their patients. While\\nabsent from this study, patient attitudes to STIs in the context of AMR will provide a deeper\\nunderstanding of the relational dynamics of such care, and what they mean for resistance.\\nTo some extent, clinician insights are already being integrated into treatment cultures, in\\neveryday clinical practice. Cultures, after all, are changeable; not static. This means current over\\nreliance on antibiotics in STI care can be ‘designed out’ (Dixon et al., 2021 ), to a degree, through\\ncultural transformation. This was apparent in participant reflections concerning the counter‐\\nculture moves they are instigating. Thinking with the idea of a counter‐culture shows how\\ntreatment cultures are already an object of enquiry open to reflexivity and critical evaluation,\\ngiving rise to new practices. These prefigurative actions also include reflections from patients\\nthemselves, who express concerns about their gut microbiome vis‐à‐vis routine antibiotic use,\\nand therefore may be open to new care practices (Davis et al., 2020 ). However, as suggested\\nthroughout our analysis, the transformation of treatment cultures will also require policies that\\naddress structural issues (Kirchhelle et al., 2020 ), such as government‐industrial relations vis‐à‐\\nvis innovation, and the prioritisation of STIs in the first place. This includes centring tradi-\\ntionally ‘undeserving’ subjects, such as MSM and sex workers, within global AMR policies,\\nwhere issues of stigma and prejudice can mean the neglect of these groups.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThis article demonstrates that a sociological framing of rising antibiotic resistance in STIs ne-\\ncessitates thinking about treatment as a cultural production to further develop a panoramic and\\nrelational understanding of the transformations that can curb resistance.

This bottom‐up approach\\ninvolves re‐designating antibiotics as precious resources, which need to be used carefully with\\nan orientation towards the future. Ultimately, findings demonstrate that a relational and net-\\nworked solution is required, where governments better support industry for scientific innova-\\ntion, and share in cost‐benefits. This has potential flow‐on effects to increase efficiency of\\ntesting and treatment, and the subsequent transformation of clinical practice, alongside a\\ncritical rethinking of the meaning of care, infection elimination and a future‐orientated\\napproach to antibiotics, involving tailored engagements with community members. As such,\\nfuture research should consider exploring community understandings of AMR and STIs, their\\nrelation to people’s sexual practices and reflections on potential solutions to the curb the rise of\\nresistance (e.g. reduction of testing for MSM). This will be crucial for developing interventions\\nthat speak to people’s everyday realities and experiences of sexual pleasure. Moreover, to\\ndevelop appropriate relational and networked solutions, further research should also focus on\\nother localised contexts, including different regions within the Global North. This will provide\\nvaluable insight into existent local sexual health infrastructures, and constructions of sexuality,\\nas they relate to the nuances of addressing antibiotic resistant STIs globally.\\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\\nShiva Chandra : Conceptualization (lead); formal analysis (equal); writing—original draft\\n(equal); writing—review & editing (equal).

National treatment \\nguidelines include ART options that can be offered immediately after diagno -\\nsis, even before the results of baseline HIV drug-resistance testing are available. \\nInitial ART selection should be guided by co-occurring conditions, including \\nviral hepatitis, medications, and other factors such as pregnancy. Identifying \\nand addressing psychosocial barriers to care is a key element of ensuring long-\\nterm adherence to treatment. The initial physical examination typically reveals \\nno clinical manifestations of HIV in the absence of advanced disease. A compre -\\nhensive laboratory evaluation, including HIV viral load and CD4 lymphocyte \\nmonitoring, is necessary to guide decision-making for treatment, opportunistic \\ninfection prophylaxis, and vaccinations. The initial management of people with \\nHIV presents a unique opportunity for family physicians to improve patients’ long-term health care and reduce HIV transmis -\\nsions.

Therefore, improved identification of acute \\ninfection allows for earlier intervention, including ART ini -\\ntiation and education about transmission prevention (i.e., \\npre- and postexposure prophylaxis for partners who are \\nseronegative).15-18 Acute symptomatic HIV is often unrecog -\\nnized, and fewer than 50% of people will have an \\nidentifiable acute illness. 19 Many respiratory ill -\\nnesses, including those caused by SARS-CoV-2 or \\ninfluenza, are more common;  therefore, a careful \\nassessment of recent risk behaviors and exposures \\nmay be a factor that prompts HIV testing.\\nEvaluation\\nHISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nAfter a diagnosis of HIV, the initial history should \\ndocument details about other chronic health con-\\nditions, hospitalizations, medications and aller -\\ngies, mental and behavioral health, substance \\nuse, sexual health history, and experience with \\nHIV pre- or postexposure prophylaxis.

When patients with \\nchronic HIV infection reengage in care, \\nclinicians should obtain a comprehen -\\nsive history of previous ART regimens \\nand treatment responses, including \\nprevious laboratory results. The ini -\\ntial examination generally shows no \\nspecific HIV-related manifestations \\nunless symptomatic acute infection or \\nadvanced HIV disease is present.\\nLABORATORY TESTING\\nThe diagnosis of HIV should be established with docu -\\nmented laboratory test results. Abnormal results from \\nhome-based, point-of-care, or rapid tests should be fol -\\nlowed with standard, instrument-based laboratory assays. \\nAfter the diagnosis is confirmed, comprehensive testing \\nshould be ordered (Table 2).4,20  Testing should include pri -\\nmary care screening and HIV-specific baseline laboratory \\ntesting with a CD4 count, quantitative plasma HIV RNA \\n(viral load), and HIV drug-resistance assessment. The CD4 \\ncount reflects the degree of immune system impairment \\nand helps determine if opportunistic infection prophylaxis \\nis indicated. The HIV viral load indicates how much active \\nviral replication is occurring. Regular viral load moni -\\ntoring during treatment is the most important indicator \\nTABLE 1\\nHIV Screening and Testing in Primary Care\\nScreen all people 15 to 65 years of age at least once;  younger adolescents \\nand older adults at increased risk should also be screened.* Retest people \\nwho are at increased risk of infection.\\nScreen all pregnant people, including those who present in labor or at \\ndelivery whose HIV status is unknown.\\nScreen all patients being considered for pre- and postexposure prophy -\\nlaxis according to established guidelines.\\nTest when acute HIV infection is suspected in people with recent expo -\\nsure history (i.e., within the previous two months) and symptoms of \\nrecent viral infection, including fever, chills, night sweats, fatigue, myalgia, \\nlymphadenopathy, headache, sore throat, and diarrhea.\\nTest when chronic HIV infection is suspected, based on clinical presen -\\ntation and risk or exposure history.

HIV drug-resistance testing guides \\nthe initial selection of the ART regimen by identifying \\nclinically significant mutations in the genes (reverse tran -\\nscriptase, protease, integrase) targeted by commonly used \\nantiretroviral drugs. Commercially available resistance \\ntests are generally highly sensitive and accurate. Studies \\nhave established the clinical and cost-effectiveness of base -\\nline resistance testing. 21\\nInitial Management\\nANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY\\nART should be started as soon as possible after diagno -\\nsis to reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality and \\nreduce transmission risk. 4,20  Durable suppression of vire -\\nmia facilitates immunologic recovery and may mitigate \\nHIV-associated inflammation and immune activation that \\ncontributes to end-organ damage. Physicians should reg -\\nularly emphasize the importance of medication adherence \\nbecause suboptimal ART adherence can promote HIV \\ndrug resistance and complicate or limit future treatment \\noptions.\\nPatients and clinicians should attempt to identify and \\naddress potential barriers to treatment and adherence, \\nincluding concerns for unintended disclosure of HIV sta -\\ntus, housing and food instability, difficulties in attending \\nappointments because of transportation challenges or \\nconflicting priorities, and lack of patient readiness and \\nmotivation. Psychiatric disorders, substance use, and psy -\\nchosocial challenges should not be reasons to withhold \\nART. Patient-centered strategies to support adherence \\nand engagement in care are pivotal to achieving desired \\nhealth outcomes. It is essential to establish how medical \\nservices and treatment costs will be covered. In addition to \\ninsurance with or without copays, HIV-specific programs \\nsuch as the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension \\nAct of 2009 Part B and AIDS Drug Assistance Programs \\ncan lower the cost barrier for patients. Social services, case \\nmanagement, HIV education and counseling, and addi -\\ntional support services are often critical for a successful \\ncare plan.\\nART can be initiated before baseline drug-resistance test \\nresults are obtained for patients who are pregnant, patients \\nwith acute or recent HIV infection, and when the patient \\nand physician decide to start ART immediately after diag -\\nnosis.  Benefits of ART initiation immediately or soon after \\ndiagnosis include increased patient engagement in care, \\nfaster time to virologic suppression, and decreased trans -\\nmission risk. 22 Once drug-resistance testing results are \\navailable, treatment can be adjusted if indicated.\\nImmediate ART initiation may not be advisable if a seri -\\nous untreated opportunistic infection is present, specifically \\none involving the central nervous system. 4,20 In such cases, \\nopportunistic infection treatment should begin before ART \\nto decrease the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory \\nsyndrome, which is an exaggerated inflammatory reaction \\nresulting from activation of latent infections, malignancies, \\nor other conditions that occur with ART-induced immune \\nsystem recovery. Expert guidance is recommended. 4,23 \\nPatients who are not ready to start ART immediately after \\ndiagnosis should be followed closely and supported, with \\nfrequent reevaluation of medication readiness and barriers \\nto initiating treatment.\\nInitial ART selection for patients who have not received \\ntreatment previously is guided by patient preference, base -\\nline laboratory results (including hepatic and renal func -\\ntion tests), adverse effect and drug interaction profiles, viral \\nhepatitis coinfection and other comorbidities, and drug \\nallergies (Table 34,20). Once-daily and single-tablet regimens \\nare widely available and covered by many HIV/AIDS drug \\nassistance programs.\\nART response is monitored by sequential measurement \\nof viral load and CD4 counts. Optimal virologic suppres -\\nsion is a confirmed HIV RNA level persistently below the \\nlower limit of detection (undetectable), which varies by \\nassay. Undetectable levels are typically achieved in eight to \\n24 weeks, depending on pretreatment viral load and ART \\nselected. Failure to achieve sustained virologic suppres -\\nsion by 24 weeks should prompt an assessment of adher -\\nence and ART drug absorption or interactions. CD4 count \\nis less helpful for assessing initial response to ART because \\nchanges in CD4 count predictably follow changes in viral \\nload. Table 2 provides recommended intervals for labora -\\ntory monitoring. 4,20  Patients with low CD4 counts starting \\nor resuming ART should be monitored closely for immune \\nreconstitution inflammatory syndrome during the first \\nweeks to months after treatment initiation. 4,20\\nOPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS\\nPrimary chemoprophylaxis against P. jiroveci pneumonia \\nis recommended for people with CD4 counts less than 200 \\ncells per µL and can be discontinued when CD4 counts \\nincrease with treatment to greater than 200 cells per µL \\nfor at least three months. 23 Patients with CD4 counts less \\nthan 100 cells per µL (0.10 × 10 9 per L) who are Toxo-\\nplasma  seropositive require chemoprophylaxis against \\nToxoplasma gondii 23;  trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or \\natovaquone (Mepron) offers sufficient prophylaxis against \\nboth.

Therefore, older patients with HIV may \\nrequire increased monitoring for medication adherence and \\ncomplications. Assessing the family’s health concerns can \\nhelp guide care, including coordination with caregivers to \\nclarify function and goals of care. 35\\nPreventing Transmission\\nPrimary care clinicians are well positioned to effectively \\nprevent HIV transmission by initiating and maintaining \\neffective ART because combination ART-induced viral load \\nsuppression dramatically reduces the risk of sexual trans -\\nmission to partners who are seronegative. 5-8 Patients should \\nbe counseled on safer sex practices to prevent sexually trans-\\nmitted infections. For patients who use drugs, information \\non harm reduction measures and substance use disorder \\ntreatment associated with decreased HIV transmission risk, \\ncan be invaluable. 36-38\\nFamily physicians are able to offer HIV pre- and post -\\nexposure prophylaxis for people at risk. 15-18 Preexposure \\nprophylaxis is recommended for people in several risk cate -\\ngories, including seronegative partners of people with HIV. \\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation \\ncriteria for preexposure prophylaxis have been published \\nin American Family Physician (AFP; https:// www.aafp.org/\\nafp/2019/1115/od1.html).

Untreated, the \\ndisease lasts many years and is divided into stages.  \\nEarly syphilis consists of primary syphilis, secondary \\nsyphilis and early latent syphilis, while late syphilis \\nconsists of late latent syphilis and tertiary syphilis \\n(neurosyphilis, cardiosyphilis and gumma).\\nPrimary syphilis classically presents as a solitary, \\npainless chancre at the site of inoculation.  \\nHowever, the primary chancre may go unnoticed \\nby patients. If untreated, the disease progresses to \\nthe secondary stage, characterized by generalized \\nmucocutaneous lesions affecting both skin, mucous \\nmembranes and lymphnodes. The rash of secondary \\nsyphilis can vary widely and mimic other infectious  \\nand non-infectious conditions, but characteristically \\naffects the palms and soles. The symptoms and signs  \\nof secondary syphilis spontaneously resolve, even \\nwithout treatment, and if left untreated, the patient \\nenters the latent stage.\\nLatent syphilis is asymptomatic, characterized  \\nby positive syphilis serology with no clinical \\nmanifestations. Latent syphilis is often divided into  \\ntwo phases: early latent syphilis is defined as infection \\nfor less than two years while late latent syphilis is  \\nthe presence of the disease for two years or more.  \\nSexual transmission typically occurs during primary, \\nsecondary or early latent stage infections; however, \\nmother-to-child transmission has been documented \\nto occur in untreated cases several years after initial \\nmaternal infection.\\nMother-to-child transmission of syphilis (congenital \\nsyphilis) is usually devastating to the fetus if maternal \\ninfection is not detected and treated sufficiently early  \\nin pregnancy. The burden of morbidity and mortality  \\ndue to congenital syphilis is high. In 2012, an estimated \\n350 000 adverse pregnancy outcomes worldwide  \\nwere attributed to syphilis, including 143 000 early  \\nfetal deaths/stillbirths, 62 000 neonatal deaths,  \\n44 000 preterm/low-birth-weight babies and 102 000 \\ninfected infants. Most untreated primary and secondary \\nsyphilis infections in pregnancy result in severe adverse \\npregnancy outcomes. Latent (asymptomatic) syphilis \\ninfections in pregnancy also cause serious adverse \\npregnancy outcomes in more than half of cases.  \\nMother-to-child transmission of syphilis is declining \\nglobally due to increased efforts to screen and treat \\npregnant women for syphilis.\\nSyphilis diagnosis is usually based on clinical history, \\nphysical examination, laboratory testing and sometimes \\nradiology. In most laboratory settings, the diagnosis is \\nbased upon serologic tests. These include treponemal \\ntests that measure antibodies to infection (including \\nTreponema pallidum haemagglutination assay [TPHA], \\nTreponema pallidum  particle agglutination assay \\n[TPPA], fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed \\n[FTA-ABS]) and non-treponemal tests that are indirect \\nmarkers measuring host immune response to infections \\n(including rapid plasma reagin [RPR], Venereal Diseases \\nResearch Laboratory [VDRL], T oluidine Red Unheated \\nSerum Test [TRUST]). Rapid treponemal tests for \\nsyphilis and dual HIV and syphilis tests are now  \\navailable. These tests will increase coverage for \\ndiagnosing syphilis.\\nRATIONALE FOR THE GUIDELINES\\nSince the publication of the WHO Guidelines for the \\nmanagement of sexually transmitted infections in 2003, \\nchanges in the epidemiology of STIs and advancements \\nin prevention, diagnosis and treatment necessitate \\nchanges in STI management. These guidelines provide \\nupdated treatment recommendations for treatment \\nof Treponema pallidum (syphilis) based on the most \\nrecent evidence. They form one of several modules of \\nguidelines for specific STIs. Other modules will focus \\non treatments for Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia), \\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae  (gonorrhoea) and genital herpes \\nsimplex virus (genital HSV). In addition, future work will \\nprovide guidance for syphilis screening and treatment \\nof pregnant women, STI syndromic approach, clinical \\nmanagement, STI prevention, and treatments of  \\nother STIs. It is strongly recommended that countries \\ntake updated global guidance into account as they \\nestablish standardized national protocols and adapt  \\nit to the local epidemiological situation and antimicrobial \\nsusceptibility data.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nThe objectives of these guidelines are:\\n•  to provide evidence-based guidance on treatment  \\nof Treponema pallidum ; and\\n•  to support countries to update their national \\nguidelines for treatment of Treponema pallidum .'),\n",

The \\nprevention and control of STIs is an integral component \\nof comprehensive sexual and reproductive health \\nservices that are needed to attain the related targets \\nunder Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) No. 3 \\n(Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all \\nages), including: target 3.2 – to end preventable deaths \\nof newborns and children under 5 years of age; target 3.3 \\n– to end the epidemics of AIDS and other communicable \\ndiseases; target 3.4 – to reduce premature mortality \\nfrom noncommunicable diseases and promote mental \\nhealth and well-being; target 3.7 – to ensure universal \\naccess to sexual and reproductive health-care services; \\nand target 3.8 – to achieve universal health coverage. \\nWorldwide, more than a million curable STIs are  \\nacquired every day. In 2012, there were an estimated \\n357 million new cases of curable STIs among adults aged \\n15–49 years worldwide: 131 million cases of chlamydia, \\n78 million cases of gonorrhoea, 6 million cases of \\nsyphilis and 142 million cases of trichomoniasis (1). \\nThe prevalence of some viral STIs is similarly high, with \\nan estimated 417 million people infected with herpes \\nsimplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) (2), and approximately  \\n291 million women harbouring human papillomavirus \\n(HPV) at any point in time (3). The burden of STIs  \\nvaries by region and gender, and is greatest in  \\nresource-poor countries.\\nWhen left undiagnosed and untreated, curable STIs  \\ncan result in serious complications and sequelae,  \\nsuch as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility,  \\nectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, fetal loss and \\ncongenital infections. In 2012, an estimated 930 000 \\nmaternal syphilis infections resulted in 350 000 adverse \\npregnancy outcomes, including stillbirths, neonatal \\ndeaths, preterm births and infected infants (4).  \\nCurable STIs accounted for the loss of nearly 11 million \\ndisability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2010 (5).  \\nThe psychological consequences of STIs include  \\nstigma, shame and loss of self-worth. STIs have also \\nbeen associated with relationship disruption and \\ngender-based violence (6). \\nBoth ulcerative and non-ulcerative STIs are associated \\nwith a several-fold increased risk of transmitting or \\nacquiring HIV (7,  8). Infections causing genital ulcers \\nare associated with the highest HIV transmission risk; \\nin addition to curable ulcer-causing STIs (e.g. syphilis \\nand chancroid), highly prevalent HSV-2 infections \\nsubstantially increase that risk (9). Non-ulcerative STIs, \\nsuch as gonorrhoea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis, \\nhave been shown to increase HIV transmission through \\ngenital shedding of HIV (10). Treating STIs with the right \\nmedicines at the right time is necessary to reduce HIV \\ntransmission and improve sexual and reproductive \\nhealth (11). Efforts should therefore be taken to \\nstrengthen STI diagnosis and treatment.\\nWHY NEW GUIDELINES FOR THE PREVENTION, \\nTREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF STI s?\\nSince the publication of the World Health Organization \\n(WHO) Guidelines for the management of sexually \\ntransmitted infections in 2003, changes in the \\nepidemiology of STIs and advancements in prevention, \\ndiagnosis and treatment necessitate changes in STI \\nmanagement. Indeed, 88% of countries have updated \\ntheir national STI guidelines or recommendations since \\n2006 (12). Updated global guidance reflecting the most \\nrecent evidence and expert opinion is therefore needed \\nto assist countries to incorporate new developments \\ninto an effective national approach to the prevention \\nand treatment of STIs.\\nThere is an urgent need to update global treatment \\nrecommendations to effectively respond to the \\nchanging antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns  \\nof STIs, especially for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.  \\nEffective treatment protocols that take into account \\nglobal and local resistance patterns are essential  \\nto reduce the risk of further development of AMR.  \\nHigh-level gonococcal resistance to quinolones, \\na previously recommended first-line treatment, \\nis widespread and decreased susceptibility to the \\nextended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporins, \\nanother first-line treatment for gonorrhoea, is on  \\nthe rise (13). Low-level resistance to Trichomonas \\nvaginalis has also been reported for nitroimidazoles,  \\nthe only available treatment. Resistance to azithromycin \\nhas been reported in some strains of Treponema \\npallidum and treatment failures have been reported \\nfor tetracyclines and macrolides in the treatment \\nof Chlamydia trachomatis (14, 15).

An increasing \\nproportion of genital ulcers are now due to viral \\ninfections as previously common bacterial infections, \\nsuch as chancroid, approach elimination in many \\ncountries (16, 17). As recommended during the STI \\nexpert consultation, treatment guidelines for genital \\nulcer disease (GUD) should be updated to include HSV-2 \\ntreatment and a longer treatment duration for HSV-2 \\nshould be explored. In addition, suppressive therapy \\nfor HSV-2 should be considered in areas with high HIV \\nprevalence (16). The chronic, lifelong nature of viral \\ninfections also requires that renewed attention be paid \\nto developing effective prevention strategies, including \\nexpanding accessibility to available vaccines for HPV  \\nand development of new vaccines for HSV-2.\\nIn the 2003 WHO guidelines, a syndromic approach \\nwas recommended for the management of STIs. \\nThe approach guides the diagnosis of STIs based on \\nidentification of consistent groups of symptoms and \\neasily recognized signs and indicates treatment for \\nthe majority of organisms that may be responsible for \\nproducing the syndrome. The syndromic management \\nalgorithms need to be updated in response to the \\nchanging situation. In addition to changes to the \\nGUD algorithm, other syndromes need to be re-\\nevaluated, particularly vaginal discharge. The approach \\nto syndromes for key populations also needs to \\nbe updated. For example, addition of a syndromic \\nmanagement algorithm for anorectal infections in \\nmen who have sex with men (MSM) and sex workers is \\nurgently needed since a substantial number of these \\ninfections go unrecognized and untreated in the \\nabsence of guidelines (16).\\nNew rapid, point-of-care diagnostic tests (POCT s) are \\nchanging STI management. Rapid syphilis diagnostic \\ntests are now widely available, making syphilis screening \\nmore widely accessible and allowing for earlier initiation \\nof treatment for those who test positive. Efforts are \\nunder way to develop POCTs for other STIs that will \\naugment syndromic management of symptomatic \\ncases and increase the ability to identify asymptomatic \\ninfections (12). Updated guidelines are needed that \\nincorporate rapid tests into syndromic management  \\nof STIs and provide algorithms for testing and  \\nscreening (16).\\nAlthough recent technological advances in diagnostics, \\ntherapeutics, vaccines and barrier methods offer better \\nopportunities for the prevention and care of STIs, access \\nto these technologies is still limited, particularly in areas \\nwhere the burden of infection is highest. For optimal \\neffectiveness, global guidelines for the management \\nof STIs need to include approaches for settings with \\nlimited access to modern technologies, as well as for \\nsettings in which these technologies are available.\\nIt is strongly recommended that countries take \\nupdated global guidance into account as they establish \\nstandardized national protocols, adapting this guidance \\nto the local epidemiological situation and antimicrobial \\nsusceptibility data. Standardization ensures that all \\npatients receive adequate treatment at every level \\nof health-care services, optimizes the training and \\nsupervision of health-care providers and facilitates \\nprocurement of medicines. It is recommended that \\nnational guidelines for the effective management of \\nSTIs be developed in close consultation with local STI, \\npublic health and laboratory experts.\\nOVERVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES FOR THE PREVENTION, TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF STI s'),\n",

It results in substantial \\nmorbidity and mortality. WHO estimates that 5.6 million \\nnew cases of syphilis occurred among adolescents and \\nadults aged 15–49 years worldwide in 2012 with a global \\nincidence rate of 1.5 cases per 1000 females and 1.5 per \\n1000 males. The estimated 18 million prevalent cases  \\nof syphilis in 2012 translates to a global prevalence \\nof 0.5% among females and 0.5% among males aged \\n15–49 years, with the highest prevalence in the WHO \\nAfrican Region (1).\\nMother-to-child transmission may occur if the \\nexpectant mother has syphilis. Mother-to-child \\ntransmission of syphilis (congenital syphilis) is usually \\ndevastating to the fetus in cases where maternal \\ninfection is not detected and treated sufficiently early \\nin pregnancy. The burden of morbidity and mortality \\ndue to congenital syphilis is high. In 2012, an estimated \\n350 000 adverse pregnancy outcomes worldwide were \\nattributed to syphilis, including 143 000 early fetal \\ndeaths/stillbirths, 62 000 neonatal deaths, 44 000 \\npreterm/low-birth-weight babies and 102 000 infected \\ninfants. There is also an increase in mother-to-child \\ntransmission of HIV among pregnant women co-\\ninfected with syphilis and HIV. Untreated primary  \\nand secondary syphilis infections in pregnancy  \\ntypically result in severely adverse pregnancy outcomes, \\nincluding fetal deaths in a substantial proportion of \\ncases. Latent syphilis infections in pregnancy result  \\nin serious adverse pregnancy outcomes in more than \\nhalf of cases. The burden of disease is highest in  \\nlow- and middle-income countries, particularly  \\nin the WHO African Region (2).\\nCongenital syphilis is preventable, however, and \\nelimination of mother-to-child transmission of syphilis \\ncan be achieved through implementation of effective \\nearly screening and treatment strategies for syphilis \\nin pregnant women (3). The fetus can be easily cured \\nwith treatment, and the risk of adverse outcomes to \\nthe fetus is minimal if the mother receives adequate \\ntreatment during early pregnancy – ideally before  \\nthe second trimester. There are indications that \\nmother-to-child transmission of syphilis is beginning  \\nto decline globally due to increased efforts to screen  \\nand treat pregnant women for syphilis.\\nCLINICAL PRESENTATION\\nSyphilis is transmitted through sexual contact with \\ninfectious lesions of the mucous membranes or abraded \\nskin, via blood transfusion, or transplacentally from a \\npregnant woman to her fetus. Untreated, the disease \\nlasts many years and is divided into stages. Early syphilis \\nconsists of primary syphilis, secondary syphilis and early \\nlatent syphilis, while late syphilis consists of late latent \\nsyphilis and tertiary syphilis. \\nPrimary syphilis classically presents as a solitary, \\npainless chancre at the site of inoculation, usually in \\nthe vagina, penis or anus (but it may be extra-genital), \\nafter a mean incubation period of 21 days (range: 9–90 \\ndays). The primary lesion begins as a raised papule \\nand ulcerates before healing within 3 to 10 weeks, \\nwith or without treatment. The primary chancre may \\ngo unnoticed by patients. If untreated, the disease \\nprogresses to the secondary stage, four to eight weeks \\nafter the appearance of the primary lesion.\\nSecondary syphilis is characterized by generalized \\nmucocutaneous lesions affecting both skin and mucous \\nmembranes. The rash of secondary syphilis can vary \\nwidely and mimic other infectious or non-infectious \\nconditions, but characteristically affects the palms and \\nsoles. The rash is often symmetrical and non-itchy, but \\nmay have several manifestations and can be minimal \\nenough to be overlooked. In warm and moist areas of \\nthe body, such as the anus and labia, large white or grey \\nraised lesions develop as a result of the spread of the \\ntreponemes from the primary lesion.'),\n",

However, it is important to \\nkeep in mind that many infants with syphilis infection  \\nwill not have obvious clinical signs or symptoms.\\nLABORATORY DIAGNOSIS\\nSyphilis diagnosis is based on the patient’s history, \\nphysical examination, laboratory testing and sometimes \\nradiology. The available laboratory tests for diagnosis  \\nof syphilis include direct detection methods (i.e. dark-\\nfield microscopy, direct fluorescent antibody test and \\nnucleic acid amplification test), serology (treponemal \\nand non-treponemal tests), and examination of \\ncerebrospinal fluids (6).\\nThese are known as condylomata lata. The lesions of  \\nthe skin and mucous membranes may be associated \\nwith non-specific constitutional symptoms of malaise, \\nfever and lymphadenopathy. The symptoms and signs  \\nof secondary syphilis spontaneously resolve, even \\nwithout treatment, and if left untreated, the patient \\nenters the latent stage.\\nLatent syphilis is characterized by positive syphilis \\nserology with no clinical symptoms or signs. Latent \\nsyphilis is often categorized in two phases: early latent \\nsyphilis is defined as infection for less than two years \\nand late latent syphilis is the presence of the disease \\nfor two years or more. The treatment of latent syphilis \\nis different for the early and late phases. Patients with \\nunknown duration of infection should be treated for late \\nlatent syphilis. Sexual transmission typically occurs  \\nonly during primary, secondary and early latent \\ninfection. Mother-to-child transmission, however,  \\nhas been documented to occur up to several years  \\nafter initial infection.\\nIf left untreated, most patients will remain in the  \\nlatent stage. Approximately 25% will develop the  \\nlate clinical sequelae of tertiary syphilis (4), which  \\ncan affect any organ system up to 30 years or more  \\nafter infection. The main manifestations of tertiary \\nsyphilis are neurological disease (neurosyphilis), \\ncardiovascular disease (cardiosyphilis) and gummatous \\nlesions (gumma).\\nNeurosyphilis can occur at any stage of syphilis \\ninfection, even in the first few months. Early neurological \\nmanifestations include acute changes in mental status, \\nmeningitis, stroke, cranial nerve dysfunction and \\nauditory or ophthalmic and ocular abnormalities.  \\nLate neurosyphilis occurs 10–30 years or more after \\ninfection and is characterized by tabes dorsalis and \\ngeneral paresis.\\nThe most common manifestation of congenital syphilis \\nis second or third trimester fetal loss or premature \\nlabour. Thus, serologic testing for syphilis should be \\nperformed for all mothers with stillborn infants, to \\ndocument evidence of syphilis. In most countries,  \\nit is estimated that the majority of congenital syphilis \\ncases result in syphilitic stillbirths, and these cases are \\noften not recognized as having been caused by syphilis. \\nInfants born to mothers with positive syphilis serology \\nshould be examined for signs and symptoms of early \\ncongenital syphilis, including bullous rash, rhinitis, \\nlaryngitis, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, \\nosteochrondritis, periostitis, meningitis and \\nchorioretinitis. The signs of late congenital syphilis \\ninfection in children over the age of 2 years include \\ninflammatory manifestations affecting the eyes, \\nears and joints, as well as skeletal malformations and \\nBOX 1.

The dark-field examination \\nmust be performed immediately after specimen \\ncollection from primary chancres, moist secondary \\nlesions or lymph nodes or from mucocutaneous lesions \\nin newborns. Dark-field microscopy requires specialized \\nequipment and a trained, experienced microscopist, and \\nis therefore usually limited to specialized laboratories. \\nDark-field microscopy is highly specific, therefore the \\npresence of characteristic spirochetes is diagnostic of \\nan active infection. Its sensitivity, however, is less than \\n50%, so a negative result does not exclude syphilis. \\nAlthough dark-field microscopy is one of the simplest \\nand most reliable methods for the direct detection of  \\nT. pallidum, its availability is increasingly limited.\\nThe direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test uses a \\nfluorescence microscope to detect spirochetes that \\nhave been stained with fluorescein-labelled anti- \\nT. pallidum globulin. Specimens are obtained in the  \\nsame way as for dark-field microscopy, but the \\nfluorescein-stained organisms are easier to detect \\nand are not likely to be confused with other organisms, \\nleading to a higher sensitivity and specificity for  \\nthe DFA test. However, specialized equipment is \\nrequired and the specific fluorescein conjugate is  \\nnot commercially available in most countries.\\nNucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) directly detect \\nT. pallidum DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) \\nfrom specimens of any lesion exudate, tissue or body \\nfluid. The sensitivity varies according to the specific \\nPCR assay; most assays can detect approximately 10 \\norganism equivalents, although some can detect one \\norganism per PCR reaction. Commercial PCR tests \\nfor T. pallidum are not yet commercially available and \\ntherefore are relatively costly compared with other \\ntests used to diagnose syphilis. For studies with testing \\ndone in well-equipped laboratories, multiplex PCR \\nassays have been developed for detection of the most \\ncommon causes of genital ulcers, including syphilis, \\nherpes simplex virus and H. ducreyi (chancroid).\\nSYPHILIS SEROLOGY\\nThere are two types of serological tests for syphilis: \\nnon-treponemal and treponemal. A presumptive \\ndiagnosis of syphilis requires a positive result from  \\nat least one of these types of tests. A confirmed \\ndiagnosis requires positive results from both types  \\nof serologic tests.\\nSerum is the specimen of choice for serological testing, \\nalthough plasma can be used in some non-treponemal \\nserological tests. Cerebrospinal fluid is used to diagnose \\ncongenital and tertiary syphilis and when neurological \\nsymptoms are present.\\nThe most widely available non-treponemal tests are the \\nmicroscopic Venereal Diseases Research Laboratory \\n(VDRL) and the macroscopic rapid plasma reagin (RPR) \\ntests. These tests detect anti-lipid immunoglobin M or \\nG (IgM or IgG) antibodies. Since these antibodies can \\nalso be produced in other diseases, non-treponemal \\ntests are not highly specific for syphilis and can give \\nfalse-positive results in conditions such as acute febrile \\nviral infections and some chronic autoimmune diseases. \\nMost false-positive results have low titres of less then  \\n1 : 4. Non-treponemal tests may be negative for up \\nto four weeks after the lesion of primary syphilis first \\nappears and can be negative in late latent syphilis; \\nadditionally in primary and secondary syphilis, these \\ntests may be false negative due to a prozone reaction \\n(i.e. interference by high concentrations of antibodies \\nin a specimen, which can be uncovered with dilution and \\nretesting). In primary syphilis, repeated testing at two \\nand four weeks may be required to exclude syphilis when \\nsuspect lesions are present. A negative non-treponemal \\ntest at three months after onset of the primary chancre \\nvirtually excludes the diagnosis of syphilis.\\nNon-treponemal tests may be qualitative or \\nquantitative. Quantitative non-treponemal test titres \\ncan be used to monitor response to treatment.  \\nTitres are expected to decrease following effective \\ntreatment and increase in untreated active infection. \\nA four-fold change or higher in titre, equivalent to a \\nchange of at least two dilutions (e.g. from 1 : 16 to 1 : 4 \\nfor effective positive response to treatment, or from  \\n1 : 8 to 1 : 32 for continued active infection) is considered \\na significant difference between two sequential \\ntests using the same method (e.g. VDRL or RPR) and \\npreferably by the same laboratory. Titres that differ  \\nby only one dilution (e.g. 1 : 8 versus 1 : 4 or 1 : 2 versus  \\n1 : 1) are not considered significant and may only \\nrepresent differences in laboratory interpretation).'),\n",

These tests are highly specific because \\nthey detect antibodies against treponemal-specific \\nantigens; however, they do not differentiate venereal \\nsyphilis from endemic syphilis (the latter includes yaws \\nand pinta). Classically, one of these tests is used as a \\nconfirmatory test following a positive non-treponemal \\ntest. Treponemal tests usually remain positive (85%)  \\nfor the patient’s lifetime, regardless of treatment.  \\nThus, a positive treponemal test does not distinguish \\nbetween active infection and infection that has been \\npreviously treated.\\nAll live or stillborn infants of seropositive mothers \\nshould be examined for evidence of congenital syphilis. \\nLive-born infants should be examined and tested at \\nbirth and at monthly intervals for three months until \\nit is confirmed that serological tests in the infant are, \\nand remain, negative. Antibodies can be passively \\ntransmitted from the mother, complicating the \\ninterpretation of laboratory results in neonates,  \\nbut usually disappear within three to four months after  \\nbirth. However, maternal antibodies can sometimes \\npersist for up to 18 months. In such cases, repeat  \\ntesting with titration should be carried out and if a  \\nfour-fold or greater increase in titre of a non-treponemal \\nor treponemal test is detected, the baby should be \\ntreated for congenital syphilis.\\nRAPID DIAGNOSTIC TESTS\\nIn the past decade, a number of point-of-care rapid \\ndiagnostic tests (RDT s) for treponemal antibodies in \\nsyphilis infection have been developed. RDT s provide \\ntreponemal antibody results in 10–15 minutes and  \\ncan be performed in any setting since they do not \\nrequire refrigerated storage or laboratory equipment. \\nThe sensitivity of the RDTs ranges from 85% to 98%  \\nand the specificity from 93% to 98%, compared to  \\nthe TPHA or TPPA as reference standards. In general, \\nRDTs with higher sensitivities tend to have lower \\nspecificities and vice versa.\\nMost of the initial range of RDTs use T. pallidum  antigens \\nto detect treponema-specific antibodies. Many of the \\ntests use immunochromatographic strips, which work \\nby having a test strip impregnated with treponemal \\nantigens that react with antibodies to syphilis in whole \\nblood or serum. The tests work on the same principle  \\nas the specific treponemal tests described above,  \\nthus a positive result does not distinguish between \\nactive and previously treated infections.\\nMore recently, tests that can detect antibodies against \\ncardiolipin-like materials have been developed that work \\non the same principle as other non-treponemal tests. \\nThey are available in combination with the treponemal \\nRDT s, providing both a screening (RPR/VDRL equivalent) \\nand confirmatory (TPHA/TPPA equivalent) component. \\nHowever, these dual RDTs have not yet been sufficiently \\nevaluated or field-tested to be recommended.\\n1.2 RATIONALE FOR NEW RECOMMENDATIONS\\nReview and reassessment of the guidelines for \\ntreatment of syphilis is needed, taking into account \\nrecent evidence on the effectiveness and antimicrobial \\nsusceptibility patterns of azithromycin. Benzathine \\npenicillin has been the recommended treatment \\nfor syphilis for more than 70 years. Doxycycline \\nis recommended as an alternative treatment for \\npenicillin-allergic, non-pregnant patients. Some \\nstudies suggest that azithromycin may be equivalent \\nto benzathine penicillin for treatment of early syphilis. \\nAzithromycin has the added advantage of single-dose \\noral administration and should be assessed as a possible \\nalternative treatment for penicillin-allergic pregnant \\npatients.

A core subgroup to focus on the \\nguidelines related to syphilis was created within the \\nGDG, to provide more intensive feedback throughout \\nthe process (Annex A). The GDG participated in \\nmeetings and teleconferences to prioritize the \\nquestions to be addressed, discuss the evidence  \\nreviews and finalize the recommendations.  \\nAdditional sub-working group teleconferences  \\nwere organized to review the methodology and  \\nresults of systematic reviews and to discuss and  \\nfinalize the evidence reviews and recommendations.  \\nThe GDG reviewed and approved the final version  \\nof the guidelines.\\n2.2 QUESTIONS AND OUTCOMES\\nIn December 2013, the first GDG meeting was held \\nto identify and agree on the key PICO (population, \\nintervention, comparator, outcome) questions that \\nformed the basis for the systematic reviews and the \\nrecommendations. Following this meeting, a survey \\nof GDG members was conducted to prioritize the \\nquestions and outcomes according to clinical relevance \\nand importance. Nine PICO questions were identified \\nfor the update on the treatment of early and late syphilis \\nand congenital syphilis (see Annex B). These questions \\npertained to adults and other special populations, \\nnamely: adolescents; pregnant women; people living \\nwith HIV; populations at high risk of acquiring and \\ntransmitting STIs, such as men who have sex with  \\nmen (MSM), transgender persons and sex workers;  \\nand infants and children below the age of 2 years (i.e. \\nthe questions on congenital syphilis). Only outcomes \\nthat were ranked as critical or important to patients and \\ndecision-making were included: serological response \\nand clinical cure, transmission to partner, antimicrobial \\nresistance (AMR), compliance, HIV transmission or \\nacquisition, STI complications and adverse effects \\n(including maternal and fetal effects in pregnant  \\nwomen) (see Annex B).\\n2.3 REVIEWS OF THE EVIDENCE\\nThe systematic reviews for each priority question \\nwere conducted by McMaster University, the WHO \\nCollaborating Centre for Evidence-Informed Policy. \\nEvidence for desirable and undesirable outcomes, \\npatient values and preferences, resources, acceptability, \\nequity and feasibility were reviewed from published and \\nunpublished literature. Comprehensive searches for \\npreviously conducted systematic reviews, randomized \\ncontrolled trials and non-randomized studies were \\nperformed up to April 2015. Additional searches \\nwere conducted to identify studies on patient values \\nand preferences (e.g. qualitative research designs) \\nand resources (e.g. cost-effectiveness studies). Two \\nmembers of the Systematic Review Team screened \\nstudies, extracted and analysed the data, and assessed \\nthe quality/certainty of the evidence using the Grading \\nof Recommendations Assessment, Development and \\nEvaluation (GRADE) approach.1\\nMETHODS\\n02\\nThese guidelines were developed following  \\nthe methods outlined in the 2014 edition of the  \\nWHO handbook for guideline development (8) \\n(see Annex B for a detailed description).\\n1 For more information, see: http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/\\nMETHODS'),\n",

When formulating the recommendations, \\nthe GDG considered and discussed the desirable and \\nundesirable effects of the interventions, the value \\nplaced on the outcomes, the associated costs and use \\nof resources, the acceptability of the interventions to \\nall stakeholders (including people affected by STIs), \\nthe impact on health equity and the feasibility of \\nimplementation. Treatments were judged according \\nto the above criteria and final decisions and guideline \\nrecommendations were agreed. The discussion was \\nfacilitated by the co-chairs with the goal of reaching \\nconsensus across the GDG. Disagreements among the \\nGDG members were noted in the evidence-to-decision \\nframework for each judgement. In the case of failure to \\nreach consensus for a recommendation, the planned \\nprocedure was for the GDG to take a vote and record \\nthe results. However, no votes were taken because \\nthe GDG reached consensus during discussion for all \\nof the recommendations. Following the meeting, the \\nrecommendations were finalized via teleconference \\nand final approval was obtained from all GDG members \\nelectronically. These guidelines were subsequently \\nwritten up in full and then peer reviewed. The External \\nReview Group approved the methods and agreed with \\nthe recommendations made by the GDG (members  \\nare listed in Annex A).\\nAccording to the GRADE approach, the strength  \\nof each recommendation was rated as either \\nstrong or conditional. Strong recommendations are \\npresented using the wording “The WHO STI guideline \\nrecommends…”, while conditional recommendations \\nare worded as “The WHO STI guideline suggests…” \\nthroughout the guidelines.

Quantifying medication needs is \\nimportant in order to estimate costs, to reconcile \\nfinancial requirements with available budget, and to \\nmake orders in advance so that the unit and freight  \\ncosts can be minimized.\\nIn order to estimate the quantity of medicines needed, \\nit will be necessary to review the medicines that are \\nrecommended for treatment, their unit prices, the \\nquantity required per treatment and the epidemiological \\ninformation on the prevalence of infection. One can \\nestimate medicine needs by multiplying the estimated \\nnumber of cases by the total quantity of medicine \\nspecified for treatment of one case. These figures  \\ncan be derived from health centres providing care but \\nthey must be verified to avoid wasteful over-ordering. \\nBudgeting for medicines is critical. If the national \\nministry of health does not provide medicines  \\nfor free and the patient cannot afford to buy the  \\nmedicines, then there will essentially be no possibility \\nof curtailing the spread of infection and the occurrence \\nof complications. At the national level it is important \\nthat decision-makers, politicians and fiscal controllers \\nunderstand the need to subsidize STI medicines. \\nLow-cost STI medicines can be obtained through \\ninternational vendors of generic products, non-\\nprofit organizations with procurement schemes \\nsuch UNICEF , UNFPA and UNHCR, and through joint \\nmedicine procurement schemes. By way of such \\nschemes, national programmes can join other national \\nprogrammes to jointly procure medicines, thus reducing \\nthe overall costs by sharing the overhead costs and \\ntaking advantage of discounts for purchasing in bulk. \\nPlacing STI medicines on national lists of essential \\nmedicines increases the likelihood of achieving a  \\nsupply of these medicines at low cost.\\nBOX 2.

Specific \\nrecommendations have also been developed \\nfor congenital syphilis caused by T. pallidum – \\nrecommendations 9 and 10 apply to infants  \\n(see section 4.3).\\n4.1 EARLY SYPHILIS  \\n(PRIMARY, SECONDARY AND EARL Y  \\nLATENT SYPHILIS OF NOT MORE THAN  \\nTWO YEARS’ DURATION)\\nADUL TS AND ADOLESCENTS \\nRECOMMENDATION 1\\nIn adults and adolescents with early syphilis, the WHO \\nSTI guideline recommends benzathine penicillin G 2.4 \\nmillion units once intramuscularly over no treatment.\\nStrong recommendation, very low quality evidence\\nRECOMMENDATION 2\\nIn adults and adolescents with early syphilis, the  \\nWHO STI guideline suggests using benzathine penicillin \\nG 2.4 million units once intramuscularly over procaine \\npenicillin G 1.2 million units 10–14 days intramuscularly.\\nConditional recommendation, very low quality evidence\\nWhen benzathine or procaine penicillin cannot be used \\n(e.g. due to penicillin allergy) or are not available (e.g.  \\ndue to stock-outs), the WHO STI guideline suggests \\nusing doxycycline 100 mg twice daily orally for 14 days  \\nor ceftriaxone 1 g intramuscularly once daily for  \\n10–14 days, or, in special circumstances, azithromycin  \\n2 g once orally.\\nConditional recommendation, very low quality evidence\\nRemarks: Doxycycline is preferred over ceftriaxone \\ndue to its lower cost and oral administration. \\nDoxycycline should not be used in pregnant women \\n(see recommendations 3 and 4 for pregnant women). \\nAzithromycin is an option in special circumstances  \\nonly when local susceptibility to azithromycin is likely.  \\nIf the stage of syphilis is unknown, recommendations  \\nfor people with late syphilis should be followed.\\nSUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE\\nOverall, there was very low quality evidence  \\nfor outcomes after treatment of early syphilis.  \\nEvidence was gathered from 7 randomized and 18  \\nnon-randomized studies, each of which included one or \\ntwo groups evaluating benzathine penicillin G, procaine \\npenicillin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin and doxycycline \\n(with or without tetracycline). Although not captured \\nin published studies, most treatments today are based \\non historical and successful use of benzathine penicillin \\nG and procaine penicillin. The number of serological \\ncures achieved with benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million \\nunits (MU) provided as a single dose intramuscularly \\n(IM) was estimated on average as 840 per 1000 people \\nwith early syphilis. When compared to this single dose \\nof benzathine penicillin G, the evidence suggests little \\nto no difference in the numbers of serological cures \\nachieved with a double dose of benzathine penicillin G; \\nlower numbers cured with a triple dose of benzathine \\npenicillin G; similar numbers cured when treated with \\nceftriaxone, azithromycin or doxycycline; and slightly \\nlower numbers cured with doxycycline and tetracycline \\ntogether. Evidence also  suggests that there may \\nbe little to no difference in the effects of different \\nmedicines in people living with HIV and those  \\nnot living with HIV. Transmission to partners,  \\nHIV transmission and acquisition, and STI  \\ncomplications were not measured.\\nFew studies provided data for adverse events. \\nAzithromycin may increase gastrointestinal side-effects \\nand dizziness or headache (3–4 times greater than \\nwith benzathine penicillin G), but it may reduce rash \\n(65% reduction), fever (50–65% reduction) and serious \\nadverse events (30% reduction). Ceftriaxone may be \\nless likely to cause diarrhoea and rash, but this evidence \\nis uncertain.

Resistance to azithromycin for other \\nconditions is spreading, and therefore the Guideline \\nDevelopment Group (GDG) was concerned about  \\nthe risk of azithromycin resistance in T. pallidum.\\nThere was some research evidence relating to overall \\nacceptability of injections versus medicines taken orally \\nin people with syphilis: approximately 10–20% of people \\nrefused injections. The GDG noted that in practice some \\nhealth-care providers are averse to providing injections, \\nand there are additional staff time and equipment costs \\nwith IM administration. The GDG raised concerns about \\nthe impending global shortage of benzathine penicillin;  \\na shortage would reduce health equity and it would not \\nbe feasible to apply the treatment recommendation.\\nThe GDG judged the benefits of treatment with \\nbenzathine penicillin G versus no treatment as large \\nbased on the historically successful treatment of \\nsyphilis over the past 70 years. It was also judged \\nthat the differences in benefits between medicines \\nused for treatment are likely to be trivial. There were \\ninconsistent results for greater benefit with higher \\ndoses of benzathine penicillin G. The differences in the \\nundesirable anticipated effects (side-effects) were \\njudged to be small. Because the benefits probably \\noutweigh the harms, and because of the potential for \\nresistance to azithromycin and greater cost, benzathine \\npenicillin G was suggested. Benzathine penicillin G was \\nalso suggested over ceftriaxone and doxycycline due  \\nto the unknown side-effects and benefits of the latter \\ntwo medicines, and the higher costs of ceftriaxone.  \\nThe GDG also judged the administration of benzathine \\nand procaine penicillins by injection as being acceptable \\nto most people.\\nPREGNANT WOMEN \\nRECOMMENDATION 3\\nIn pregnant women with early syphilis, the WHO STI \\nguideline recommends benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million \\nunits once intramuscularly over no treatment. \\nStrong recommendation, very low quality evidence\\nRECOMMENDATION 4\\nIn pregnant women with early syphilis, the WHO STI \\nguideline suggests using benzathine penicillin G 2.4 \\nmillion units once intramuscularly over procaine \\npenicillin 1.2 million units intramuscularly once daily  \\nfor 10 days.\\nConditional recommendation, very low quality evidence\\nWhen benzathine or procaine penicillin cannot be \\nused (e.g. due to penicillin allergy where penicillin \\ndesensitization is not possible) or are not available (e.g. \\ndue to stock-outs), the WHO STI guideline suggests \\nusing, with caution, erythromycin 500 mg orally four \\ntimes daily for 14 days or ceftriaxone 1 g intramuscularly \\nonce daily for 10–14 days or azithromycin 2 g once orally.\\nConditional recommendation, very low quality evidence\\nRemarks: Although erythromycin and azithromycin treat \\nthe pregnant women, they do not cross the placental \\nbarrier completely and as a result the fetus is not \\ntreated. It is therefore necessary to treat the newborn \\ninfant soon after delivery (see recommendations 9 and \\n10 for congenital syphilis). Ceftriaxone is an expensive \\noption and is injectable. Doxycycline should not be used \\nin pregnant women. Because syphilis during pregnancy \\ncan lead to severe adverse complications to the fetus or \\nnewborn, stock-outs of benzathine penicillin for use in \\nantenatal care should be avoided. \\nSUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE\\nThe overall quality of the evidence for treatments \\nused for pregnant women was very low. There were \\nfew studies (10 non-randomized studies) and very \\nfew pregnant women included in the studies. In most \\nstudies, the stage of syphilis (early or late) was unknown. \\nThe evidence in adults and adolescents, and the \\nevidence from successful historical use of benzathine \\nand procaine penicillins and erythromycin, was used to \\ninform the judgements about the benefits of different \\nmedicines. The benefits were large for the use of \\nbenzathine penicillin compared to no treatment.  \\nThe differences in medicines in terms of benefits and \\nharms were trivial. Prevention of mother-to-child \\ntransmission (PMTCT) was a critical outcome.

Doxycycline should not be used \\nin pregnant women. Because syphilis during pregnancy \\ncan lead to severe adverse complications to the fetus  \\nor newborn, stock-outs of benzathine penicillin for  \\nuse in antenatal care should be avoided.\\nSUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE\\nOverall, the quality of the evidence was very low.  \\nMost studies typically include people with early or late \\nsyphilis and don’t distinguish between the stage of \\nsyphilis when reporting the results. However, one study \\nincluded over 300 people diagnosed with late syphilis.  \\nIt evaluated benzathine penicillin G 2.4 MU given once IM \\nand azithromycin 2 g given once orally. Serological cure \\nwas low (33–39%); these doses are typically provided \\nfor early syphilis. Another study included 135 pregnant \\nwomen treated for late syphilis. This study found that \\n99% of women with the double dose of benzathine \\npenicillin G were cured. Historically, multiple doses of \\nbenzathine penicillin G (once a week for three weeks) \\nor procaine penicillin 1.2 MU (once daily for 20 days) \\nhave been successful for serological and clinical cure \\nof syphilis. For pregnant women, PMTCT is a critical \\noutcome. Penicillins cross the placental barrier,  \\nwhile azithromycin and erythromycin do  \\nnot, meaning that there is an increased chance  \\nof mother-to-child transmission of syphilis with  \\nthe use of the latter medicines.\\nThere has been some successful historical use of \\ndoxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 30 days, but not \\nin pregnant women. There were no data for adverse \\nevents, transmission to partners, HIV transmission and \\nacquisition, or STI complications. There are no reported \\ndata on resistance to azithromycin for treating syphilis  \\nin specific settings, and this will likely remain unknown  \\nin many places as the capacity to monitor AMR in  \\nT. pallidum is not available in many settings. Resistance \\nto azithromycin for other conditions is spreading, and \\ntherefore the STI GDG was concerned about the risk  \\nof azithromycin resistance in T. pallidum.'),\n",

There was some \\nresearch evidence relating to overall acceptability of \\ninjections versus medicines taken orally in people  \\nwith syphilis: approximately 10–20% of people refused \\ninjections. The GDG noted that in practice some health-\\ncare providers are averse to providing injections, and \\nthere are additional staff time and equipment costs with \\nIM administration. The GDG raised concerns about the \\nimpending global shortage of benzathine penicillin; a \\nshortage would reduce health equity and it would not  \\nbe feasible to apply the treatment recommendation.\\nThe GDG judged the benefits of treatment with \\nbenzathine penicillin G versus no treatment as large \\nbased on the historically successful treatment of \\nsyphilis over the past 70 years. It was also judged that \\nthe differences in benefits between medicines used \\nfor treatment are likely to be trivial. The differences \\nin the undesirable anticipated effects (side-effects) \\nwere judged to be small. Because the benefits probably \\noutweigh the harms, and because of the potential for \\nresistance to azithromycin, greater cost and lack of \\nhistorical data for azithromycin, benzathine penicillin  \\nG and procaine penicillin were suggested. The penicillins \\nwere suggested over doxycycline due to the lack of \\nhistorical data in late syphilis and unknown side-effects \\nand benefits of doxycycline.

The sample sizes of most studies \\nwas small, and rates of follow-up of babies achieved \\nafter treatment were very low. When there was  \\nfollow-up, it ranged from six months to one year. \\nTreatments provided included aqueous benzyl \\npenicillin, procaine penicillin and benzathine penicillin \\nG; ceftriaxone was not assessed. In most studies of \\ninfants with confirmed congenital syphilis or infants \\nwhose mothers received inadequate or no treatment, \\ntreatment of infants resulted in 100% cures with no \\nadverse effects. Aqueous benzyl penicillin or procaine \\npenicillin were favoured over ceftriaxone due to little \\nor no data, and known potential for side-effects and \\ncontraindications with the use of ceftriaxone to treat \\nother conditions. There were some historical data (but \\nno other data) indicating that benzathine penicillin G \\nmay have benefit and few adverse effects, but this is \\nuncertain. There were no follow-up data for untreated \\ninfants who were clinically normal and born to mothers \\nwho had received adequate treatment. From global \\nestimates, the risk of congenital syphilis for infants born \\nalive to mothers with untreated syphilis is approximately \\n16 per 100 mothers. A systematic review found that \\nwhen mothers are treated, the risk of congenital syphilis \\nis 0.03 times the risk in infants born to untreated \\nmothers; from this it can be roughly estimated that \\nthere would be 4.8 births with congenital syphilis per \\n1000 treated mothers. Only half of these infants (2.4 per \\n1000) would be expected to show signs or symptoms of \\ncongenital syphilis. Therefore, in 1000 treated mothers, \\nthere would be a risk of two to three infants born with \\ncongenital syphilis who are clinically normal.\\nThere was little cost difference between aqueous benzyl \\npenicillin or procaine penicillin, but ceftriaxone was \\nmore expensive. The GDG agreed that the medicines \\nare available and thus availability would likely not \\nhave an impact on equity. However, for people who \\nneed to travel for treatment, health equity may be \\nreduced. The GDG agreed that IM injections would be \\nacceptable, given that finding a vein for intravenous \\n(IV) administration is often very difficult for infants. \\nHowever, if an experienced venupuncturist is present \\nand willing, benzyl penicillin could be administered IV.\\nOverall, historical data show benefits of treatment with \\naqueous benzyl penicillin and procaine penicillin with few \\nto no adverse effects, and similar costs. There are little \\nto no data for benzathine penicillin G, but there may be \\nno adverse effects; there are also little to no data for \\nceftriaxone but adverse effects may occur and it is more \\nexpensive than the other medicines. A preference for \\nIM injections or IV administration was not determined, \\nbut these options are available with either medication. \\nOverall, the risk of congenital syphilis in infants born to \\nmothers who have received adequate treatment was \\njudged to be very low and therefore, monitoring of  \\nthese infants is suggested over treatment.'),\n",

After the meeting, surveys pertaining to  \\neach of the four STI topic areas (i.e. gonorrhoea, \\nchlamydia, syphilis and genital herpes simplex virus  \\nwere administered among subgroups of the GDG \\nmembers with expertise relating to the relevant STIs. \\nThe goal of the surveys was to rank the population, \\ninterventions and outcomes for each specific STI \\ncondition by importance. The surveys required the \\nmembers of the STI subgroups to rank the population, \\ninterventions and outcomes on a scale of 1 to 9,  \\nfrom lowest to highest priority.\\nFour different priority STI surveys were conducted,  \\nand each survey attained a 90–100% response rate \\nfrom the STI subgroup members. The survey results for \\npriority populations, interventions and outcomes were \\nanalysed. Populations, interventions and outcomes with \\nan average rating of 7 to 9 were considered “critical”; \\nthose with an average rating of 4 to 6 were considered \\n“important”; and those with an average rating of 1 to \\n3 were considered “not important” and were thus not \\ncovered in the guidelines. Some questions that scored \\nless than 7 were kept for consistency.\\nThe number of comparisons in each question was also \\nreduced; only “critical” interventions were compared \\nwith each other and with important interventions.  \\nThus, “important” interventions were not compared  \\nto each other. \\nA revised list of questions was then compiled and all \\nmembers of the full STI GDG were requested to review \\nthe priority questions. The priority questions were  \\nthen revised based on this feedback.\\nNine questions were identified for the update \\nof the syphilis guidelines and used to inform the \\nrecommendations.

When synthesized evidence \\nabout benefits and harms for an intervention was not \\navailable or the synthesized evidence was not up to date, \\na new systematic review of randomized controlled trials \\n(RCTs) and non-randomized studies was conducted.\\nThe search strategies were developed by an information \\nspecialist trained in systematic reviews. The strategies \\nincluded the use of keywords from the controlled \\nvocabulary of the database and text words based on \\nthe PICO questions. There were no restrictions based \\non language, publication status or study design. RCTs \\nwere included for critical and important outcomes, and \\nnon-randomized studies for critical outcomes when no \\nevidence was available from RCT s. Additional strategies \\nincluded contacting Cochrane review groups and \\nauthors of study protocols.\\nThe Cochrane Library suite of databases (Cochrane \\nDatabase of Systematic Reviews [CDSR], Database \\nof Abstracts of Reviews of Effects [DARE], Health \\nTechnology Assessment [HTA] database and the \\nAmerican College of Physicians [ACP] Journal Club) \\nwas searched for published systematic reviews and \\nprotocols up to January 2014.\\nSearch strategy:\\n1. treponema.mp.\\n2. pallidum.mp.\\n3. syphilis.mp.\\n4. chancre*.mp.\\n5. or/1-4\\nPrimary studies were searched for in the Cochrane \\nCentral Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (up to \\nMarch 2015), MEDLINE and Embase databases (up to  \\n26 February 2015) and LILACS (up to 19 April 2015). \\nREVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE The strategies included searching for subject headings \\nand text words related to syphilis and specific \\ninterventions (e.g. medication names and classes). \\nAdditional strategies included checking reference lists \\nand consulting with the GDG for any missed articles.\\nSCREENING STUDIES, DATA EXTRACTION  \\nAND ANAL YSIS\\nT wo researchers independently screened titles and \\nabstracts of systematic reviews identified through \\ndatabase searching to determine studies eligible for \\ninclusion in the analysis. Disagreements were resolved \\nby discussing study inclusion with a third member of \\nthe research team. Data were extracted using a pilot-\\ntested form for patient characteristics (including the \\nsubgroups identified by the GDG), diagnosis, treatment \\n(dose, schedule, etc.), setting, follow-up and outcomes. \\nT wo investigators independently abstracted data. \\nRisk of bias of each study was also assessed using risk \\nof bias tools appropriate for RCTs (http://handbook.\\ncochrane.org/chapter_8/8_assessing_risk_of_bias_\\nin_included_studies.htm) and using the Risk Of Bias In \\nNon-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I; \\npreviously called ACROBAT) tool to assess non-\\nrandomized studies (www.riskofbias.info).\\nTo measure the treatment effect, the data were \\nanalysed using RevMan 5.2. 12 \\nFor dichotomous outcomes, we calculated relative risks \\nwith 95% confidence intervals (e.g. risk ratios and odds \\nratios) by pooling results from RCTs and pooling results \\nfrom non-randomized studies using the random effects \\nmodel. Moderate to high heterogeneity (I2 > 50%) was \\nexplored. Effects were converted to absolute effects \\nusing the calculated relative effect and a representative \\nbaseline risk (agreed upon by the GDG).

First, while screening studies for \\nthe effects of treatments and costs, two investigators \\nidentified studies of potential relevance in these areas. \\nSecondly, a separate search was conducted in MEDLINE, \\nEmbase and PsycINFO from January 2000 to July 2015. \\nText words and keywords for the different STIs were \\nused in combination with words such as “preference”, \\n“adherence”, “satisfaction”, “attitudes”, “health utilities” \\nand “value”, “equity” and “feasibility”. The results \\nincluded 2563 unique references. T wo investigators \\nscreened the studies, and 162 studies were identified  \\nfor full text retrieval. Any study design was included  \\nthat addressed equity or feasibility. In addition,  \\nwhen adherence was measured in RCTs or non-\\nrandomized studies, the data were collected, \\nsynthesized and presented in the evidence profiles  \\nfor each PICO question.\\nThe following study designs were included:\\na.  Patient utilities and health status values studies: \\nThese studies examine how patients value alternative \\nhealth states and their experiences with treatment. \\nThe measurement techniques used can include: \\nstandard gamble, time trade-off, visual analogue \\nscale, or mapping results based on generic surveys \\n(EuroQol five dimensions health questionnaire [EQ-\\n5D] or the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-36]) \\nor specific measurement (e.g. St George Respiratory \\nQuestionnaire) of health-related quality of life.\\nb.  Studies of patients’ direct choices when presented \\nwith decision aids: These studies examine the  \\nchoices patients make when presented with decision \\naids for management options (i.e. probabilistic  \\ntrade-off techniques).\\nc.  Studies on non-utility measurement of health states: \\nThese studies quantitatively examine patients’  \\nviews, attitudes, satisfaction or preferences  \\nthrough questionnaires or scales; these are neither \\nutility studies nor studies of patients’ responses to \\ndecision aids. Patients are asked about how desirable \\nor aversive a particular outcome is for them.  \\nThis category includes some studies that  \\nuse questionnaires or scales.\\nd.  Qualitative studies: These studies explore patients’ \\nviews, attitudes, satisfactions or preferences related \\nto different treatment options based on qualitative \\nresearch methods including focus group discussions, \\ninterviews, etc.\\nFrom the search, we included 17 studies reporting \\ninformation relating to different STIs. In many  \\ninstances, data for all infections informed the evidence \\nfor syphilis specifically.\\nRESOURCES\\nWe searched the published literature for evidence  \\non use of resources and obtained data on direct costs  \\nof medicines.\\nBased on the list of possible treatments identified by \\nthe GDG, an estimate of the cost associated with each \\nalternative was calculated. This costing estimate refers \\nonly to the actual market price of the medication and \\ndoes not include the costs of other resources that  \\ncould be involved, such as syringes, injection time or \\nneedle disposal.\\nData were presented in a table and included: treatment, \\ndose per day, treatment duration, days, medicine cost \\nper dose, medicine cost per full course of treatment, \\nand 25% of procurement costs (as defined in the 2014 \\nManagement Sciences for Health (MSH) International \\ndrug price indicator guide)13. A final price for a full \\ncourse of treatment for each medicine by dosage was \\ncalculated as the number of doses per day, multiplied by \\nthe number of days of the treatment, plus 25% of the \\nprocurement costs for the medicines used. The unit \\nprice of the medicine was obtained from the median \\nprices provided in the 2014 MSH International drug \\nprice indicator guide and information available on the \\nInternet. In order to determine a precise and reliable \\nestimate, the price per unit (all expressed in US dollars) \\nwas provided only when the information available \\nmatched the dosage of interest (grams per pill or 1000 \\nunits per vial). No calculations were made based on \\nassumptions about the cost per unit of hypothetical \\npackaging not listed in the directory.\\nThe major medical databases were also searched \\n(MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library for \\nEconomic Evaluation and T echnology Assessment \\nreports) from January 2005 to July 2015. In addition, \\nwhile screening studies for the effects of treatments, \\ntwo investigators also identified studies of potential \\nrelevance for costs. No studies were identified for \\nresource use relating to treatment of syphilis.\\n13  International drug price indicator guide, 2014 edition (updated annually).

Briefly, the GRADE \\napproach assesses the quality of evidence for treatment \\ninterventions using well-established criteria for \\nthe design, risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, \\nimprecision, effect size, dose–response curve and  \\nother considerations that may affect the quality of  \\nthe evidence. Two investigators used the GRADE \\napproach to assess the quality and level of certainty  \\nof the evidence. The evidence profiles for each \\nrecommendation are available in Web annex D.\\nEVIDENCE- TO-DECISION FRAMEWORKS\\nEvidence-to-decision frameworks were also developed \\nusing GRADEpro software (www.gradepro.org). \\nEvidence-to-decision frameworks present the desirable \\nand undesirable effects of the interventions, the value \\nof the outcomes, the costs and resource use, the \\nacceptability of the interventions to all stakeholders, \\nthe impact on health equity, and the feasibility of \\nimplementation (i.e. the GRADE criteria for making \\ndecisions). The evidence-to-decision frameworks \\nare based on a population perspective for these \\nrecommendations. All GRADE criteria were  \\nconsidered from this perspective.\\nMAKING THE RECOMMENDATIONS\\nIn October 2015, the GDG met to make the \\nrecommendations. This meeting was facilitated by  \\ntwo co-chairs – one with expertise in GRADE and the \\nother with clinical expertise of syphilis. During the \\nmeeting, the evidence profiles and evidence-to-decision \\nframeworks were presented by the methodologists.  \\nThe GDG discussed each GRADE criterion and judged \\nwhich intervention was favoured. Then a final decision \\nand guideline recommendation was developed.  \\nThe goal was to arrive at agreement across all members \\nof the GDG and this was facilitated by the chairpersons \\nthrough discussion. When there was disagreement for \\na criterion, it was noted in the evidence-to-decision \\nframework for the relevant judgement. If there was \\ndisagreement for any of the final recommendations,  \\nthe plan was for the GDG to vote and the numbers to  \\nbe recorded. Because there was no disagreement for \\nany of the final recommendations, however, votes  \\nwere not taken or reported in these guidelines.\\nThe GDG made a strong or conditional recommendation \\nfor or against each intervention and described special \\ncircumstances in the remarks. Research implications \\nwere also developed and presented, based on the gaps \\nidentified in the evidence. Following the meeting, the \\nrecommendations were finalized via teleconference, \\nand final approval was obtained from the GDG members \\nelectronically. All decisions and discussions from the \\nGDG for each recommendation are available in the \\nevidence-to-decision frameworks in Web annex D. \\n14  Schünemann H, Brożek J, Guyatt G, Oxman A, editors.
